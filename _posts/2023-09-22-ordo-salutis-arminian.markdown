Ordo salutis is a latin phrase for “The Order of Salvation” and was first coined by Lutheran theologians Franz Buddeus and Jacob Carpov in the first half of the eighteenth century. **This article is not an endorsement.**

<!-- Arminian theology is a counter reformation that erroneously reintroduces synergism back in the the Church. While this may be true, it is also true that I believe that they are saved based on a [technicality](https://youtu.be/t2cZ0-CJ6iM). I have no doubt that may lives were brought to Christ through Graham. -->

<!-- Synergism says that humans and God work together to bring about salvation. While those listed here are not in cults, the cults have also been synergistic, as Christianity is monergistic historically. -->

<!-- - 3.1 Southern Baptist Convention (SBC)
    - 3.1.1 Billy Graham (Self-directed) -->

⚠️ Arminians are thrice [synergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/synergism/). They view regeneration, sanctification, and perseverance as a synergistic activity. Denominations associated with this theological tradition are Wesleyan and Methodist.

<!-- It's also possible they are [Semi-Pelagian](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/). -->

1. **Universal, external calling**
    - God extends the call to salvation to all by a general work of the Spirit on the soul and by explicit Gospel proclamation. [Prevenient or “exciting” grace](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/), which allegedly proceeds universally from the Cross, alleviates the effects of depravity, thereby freeing all persons for moral and spiritual action.
        
    <!-- >⚠️ [Semi-Pelagianism](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/) is a modification of the Pelagianism heresy which was officially condemned by the church at the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431. Semi-Pelagianism was also condemned by the Council of Orange in 529 A.D.  -->

2. **Repentance and faith**
    - Since every person is transformed by prevenient grace, the human will is capable of freely turning from sin unto Christ. Given the fact that God commands sinners to work out their own salvation (Phil 2:12), conversion is a **synergistic activity**.
        >⚠️ Arminians view regeneration synergistically; the new birth occurs as a result of human willing and divine working. p. 35.

3. **Justification**
    - Since God does not declare anyone righteous in principle who is not so in practice, the forensic view of justification (the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to believing sinners) often is rejected. Arminians usually define justification as forgiveness of sins that in turn fosters the moral government of the universe.
4. **Sanctification**
    - Believers should seek that instantaneous, second blessing experience by which the Spirit eradicates sin and fills the heart with perfect love for God and others. This second work of grace is denoted “entire sanctification,” “Christian perfection,” and the “fullness of the blessing.” The term regeneration often is used inclusively to embrace the broad movement of salvation from conversion to sanctification.
        >⚠️ Furthermore, some affirm that God wills that sanctification be perfected in this life by a second work of grace that is said to eradicate the sinful nature and its desires, fill the heart with perfect love for God, and enable Christians to live without willful sin. This decisive post-conversion experience is designated “entire sanctification,” “sinless perfection,” and “full salvation.” p. 35.

5. **Perseverance**
    - Given their strong emphasis on free agency, many Arminians hold that believers by willful sin may fall completely from the state of grace. The possibility of final apostasy motivates Christians to holiness and constancy of life.
        >⚠️  In addition, many Arminians deny the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. They insist that by deliberate sin Christians can renounce their prior faith commitment and thereby fall from the state of grace, forfeit eternal salvation, and be doomed to perdition. The Arminian understanding of salvation thus is synergistic (a “working together”); divine grace and the liberated human will cooperate to bring about salvation. From inception to consummation the unsaved via free will make significant contributions to the outworking of their salvation. p. 35.
