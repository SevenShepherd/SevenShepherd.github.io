Ordo salutis is a latin phrase for “The Order of Salvation” and was first coined by Lutheran theologians Franz Buddeus and Jacob Carpov in the first half of the eighteenth century. **This article is not an endorsement.**

⚠️ The order of salvation in Roman Catholic theology is usually expressed in terms of the grace mediated by the church’s sacraments. Roman Catholicism is considered legalistic in it's [synergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/synergism/) and [sacerdotalist](https://carm.org/dictionary/sacerdotalism/) theology. They also deviated from St. Thomas Aquinas who taught a form of Augustinian predestination.

1. **The sacrament of *baptism*** (Tit 3:5) 
    - imparts supernatural life by regenerating the soul and uniting it with Christ. Water baptism, in addition, is said to remove the guilt and penalty of original sin. Through the sacrament of baptism “Man is made white as a sheet, brighter than snow.”
2. **The sacrament of *confirmation*** (Acts 8:15-17)
    - strengthens the baptized through a Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Spirit. By this endowment the confirmed are enabled to witness to Christ and to stand firm in the midst of life’s struggles.
3. **The sacrament of the *Eucharist*** (Matt 26:26-28) 
    - imparts spiritual nourishment as the worshiper feeds on the body and blood of Christ in the transubstantiated wafer. “This sacrament is nourishment. It is for the divine life of the soul what food and drink are for the life of the body. This life, the state of grace, is maintained by it, preserved from ruin, strengthened and augmented.”13
4. **The sacrament of *penance*, or the “second pardon,”** 
    - remits the guilt and punishment of post-baptismal, mortal sins (apostasy, murder, adultery). The sacrament requires of the penitent contrition for sins, confession, and works of satisfaction (almsgiving, fasting, etc.).
5. **The sacrament of *extreme unction or last anointing*** (Jas 5:14-16)
    - equips the soul for the final conflict with death and prepares the recipient for the beatific vision of God. This sacrament “gives the grace of a good death, consolation in that depression which comes to so many because of the memory of their sins, and pardon for all sins not yet forgiven in confession.”
