<!-- 🚶📜 How The 80's \"Free Grace\" Movement Departs From Scripture, Indoctrinating Innocent Children Into Lifestyles Of Sin And False Assurance -->

After learning about these unscriptural modern movements, I cringed hard and fled into the safety of historical forms of Christianity. It is clear that these modern movements depart from the Holy Scriptures. It’s also worrying that these “movements” will likely indoctrinate innocent children into lifestyles of sin and false assurance. So, consider this article a warning to avoid the strange movements, sects, & cults, 19th century or later.

This article is meant to be short since I've already debunked the movements and theologies implied here in other articles. I think it is clear that any theology holding to these points are not sound and have departed from the scriptures.

<a name="alone" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">🚶📜 1. Not the "Faith Alone" of the Reformation</a>

![Antinomianism](/assets/images/free-grace-antinomianism.jpg)

**See the following articles [Not The Faith Alone Of The Reformation](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/), [Christians Do Not Practice Sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/), [This Is How You Know You're Saved](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/), and [The Heresy Of Antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/antinomian-heresy/).**

<a name="blind" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.1 Turning A Blind Eye To Scripture</a>

❌ Modern movements distort the reformation doctrine of *sola fide* or faith alone by removing parts of the full definition that interferes with their lifestyles of sin, and in doing so they depart from scripture. The reason they do this is to justify their own behavior contrary to Biblical teaching.

<!-- to devise a way of being Christian that completely ignores scripture -->

<!-- Briefly, they push for easily disprovable interpretations of scripture that allow them to live lifestyles of sin, and in doing so, have become antinomian. The true definition of faith alone can be seen below:

Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26). Therefore Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify. -->

✔️ The reformation saw the systematization of the sound doctrine of *sola fide* or &ldquo;faith alone&rdquo;. Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph. 2:10). 

> “We are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone” ... “Therefore Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify.”

The second half of the definition of faith alone &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***&rdquo; protects us from antinomianism (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62), while the first half protects us from legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28). So we can confidently conclude that the second half of the doctrine of &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***&rdquo; is absolutely necessary!

> Christians do not "practice" sin (1 Jn 3:6-10,31; 5:18; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6), abuse grace as a license to sin (Jd 4 NET), or remain in a lifestyle of sin (Ro 6:1-2,15; Gal 5:19-21). If they do, they give strong evidence of false profession (1Jn 2:4; Mt 10:38; Mt 18:3 NLT; Lk 9:23,62). &mdash; [Theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#alone)

<a name="regen" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.1 Lack Of Wisdom On Regeneration</a>

❌ Modern movements and progressives love to depart from scripture and take repentance out of context. They showcase their inability to understand scripture when they attack Christians for repeating the true teachings of Christ on repentance (Lk 13:3). They inadvertently accuse Christ himself (Mt 4:17) and the Apostles (Acts 17:30) of teaching works when no one is doing that. This error in understanding comes from a lack of wisdom surrounding regeneration.

<!-- ❌ Modern movements and progressives love to depart from scripture and take repentance out of context. They showcase their inability to understand scripture by essentially accusing Christ himself (Mt 4:17) and the Apostles (Acts 17:30) of teaching works. They do this inadvertently when they attack Christians for repeating the true teachings of scripture. -->

✔️ Clearly those who would perish (Lk 13:3) from not heeding the command to repent (Ac 17:30) are not genuine about their faith (1Jn. 2:4; 2Cor. 13:5), because if their faith was real, they would have desired to obey Christ's command to repent (Mt 4:17; Acts 17:30). This reasoning preserves faith alone and exposes those who do not truly love God (Jn 14:15,21).

> No, I tell you; **but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless</span> you repent**, you will **all** likewise <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">perish</span>. &mdash; Luke 13:3 ESV

<!-- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith, and is defined as a turning away from sin to God that leads to salvation and eternal life. Unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (2Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18; Acts 26:15-20; Acts 3:19; Luke 17:3-4; 1Cor. 5:12-13) -->

God has granted the repentance (Ac 11:18; 2 Tim. 2:25), and commanded us to repent (Ac 17:30; Mt 4:17; Lk 13:3). **Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith**, and is defined as a turning away from sin to God (Acts 26:20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), for the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31). It is His kindness (Ro 2:4) that leads us to this godly sorrow and contrition which produces a repentance that leads to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18). Unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (Luke 17:3-4 NLT; 1Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).

<a name="turn" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.2 Turn Away From Sin Not Change Of Mind</a>

❌ Modern movements also like to misapply the incorrect meaning of [metanoéō](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [metánoia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) in the new testament. This leads them to erroneously believe that, either repentance doesn't require them to turn from sin (interfering with their lifestyle), or they acknowledge the truth and twist the scripture by saying it's optional. As we've seen above, it is not optional unless death is appealing to you. Let's investigate this further.

✔️ Teaching repentance, as Christ did, does not conflict with *Sola Fide* or &ldquo;Faith Alone&rdquo; because repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith. Saving faith "results" in (**not** &ldquo;includes&rdquo;) obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" (**not** merits) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). **It's post-justification.** Once you're already saved, someone who was genuine about their faith would desire to repent. This article is teaching dispositions of the heart post-justification.

- 🍇 God says, *&ldquo;No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.&rdquo;* (Luke 13:3 ESV)
- 🧑 Repentance does not merit salvation, salvation produces repentance. -->

As [every authoritative Greek lexicon](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) reveals, every instance of [metanoéō](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [metánoia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) means *“feel remorse, repent, be converted” (in religio-ethical sense)*, it is a contrition (2Cor. 7:10) that leads to a turning away from sin to God (Acts 26:20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), for the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31), leading to salvation (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).

No authoritative Greek lexicon or English translation of the Bible translates the Greek terms [metanoéō (μετανοέω)](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [metánoia (μετάνοια)](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) as <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">"change your mind"</span> for New Testament passages. This meaning finds **no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation**... <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">It is a definition unique to modern  movements</span>, **without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference work**. It also lacks support from any English translation of the Bible.

Repentance, obedience, and good works are all fruits of genuine saving faith. Fruits of already being saved; that's why we say they're not optional, because if the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10). No one is speaking of meriting salvation.

When you falsely teach anti-Christ doctrines of optional repentance, you teach child molesters to keep molesting, murderers to keep murdering, rapists to keep raping, occultists to keep sacrificing to demons, and idolaters to keep their idolatries. You fill the church with monsters and hypocrites who prey on little children and you understand nothing of faith alone, scripture, or Christ.
