In these incredibly worrying times, it has become evident that some in teaching positions are unable to distinguish between sound doctrine and systematic theology. As a Protestant leader committed to the truth of Scripture, it is essential to address this issue with clarity and compassion. Sound doctrine is the bedrock of our faith, derived directly from the Bible and centered on the core tenets of Christianity. Systematic theology, on the other hand, is the disciplined study and organization of these doctrines, helping believers understand the coherence and unity of biblical truths. Confusing these two not only muddles our understanding but also misleads those we are called to guide.

The current trend of conflating sound doctrine with systematic theology is not just an academic misstep but a spiritual danger. Sound doctrine is the essential truth that all believers must hold: the deity of Christ, the reality of the Trinity, the sufficiency of Scripture, and the necessity of grace for salvation. Systematic theology serves to deepen our understanding of these truths, organizing them into a comprehensive framework. When false teachers blur these lines, they often introduce personal interpretations and speculative ideas as if they were foundational truths, leading many astray. It is crucial to call out such errors and reaffirm our commitment to the clear, unambiguous teachings of the Bible.

In this context, fulfilling the Great Commission takes on renewed urgency. Christ called us to make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all He has commanded. This means we must ensure our teachings are rooted in sound doctrine, clearly distinguishing it from the valuable but distinct discipline of systematic theology. To the false teachers spreading confusion, I urge you to return to the simplicity and purity of the Gospel. Let us, as those truly called by Christ, uphold the truth with integrity and diligence, guiding others toward a genuine understanding of God's Word.

To reinforce the call for all believers, not just pastors, to spread the gospel, we can turn to several key Bible verses from the English Standard Version (ESV) that emphasize this important responsibility:

1. **Matthew 28:19-20 (ESV)**: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age." This passage, known as the Great Commission, is directed to all followers of Christ, encouraging every believer to share the gospel and teach others.

2. **Acts 1:8 (ESV)**: "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." Jesus' instruction to be His witnesses extends to all His followers, empowering every believer through the Holy Spirit to spread His message far and wide.

3. **1 Peter 3:15 (ESV)**: "But in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect." This verse highlights the importance of being ready to share our faith and the reasons for our hope in Christ with others, emphasizing a respectful and gentle approach.

4. **2 Timothy 4:2 (ESV)**: "Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching." While this instruction was given to Timothy, it applies to all believers, encouraging us to be ready to share God's Word at all times.

5. **Romans 10:14-15 (ESV)**: "How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, 'How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!'" These verses remind us that the proclamation of the gospel relies on every believer's willingness to share the good news.

6. **Mark 16:15 (ESV)**: "And he said to them, 'Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.'" Jesus' command here is clear and inclusive, calling all His followers to spread the gospel universally.

These verses collectively affirm that the responsibility of spreading the gospel lies with every believer. As Christians, we are all called to participate in the Great Commission, sharing the transformative message of Christ with the world around us.
