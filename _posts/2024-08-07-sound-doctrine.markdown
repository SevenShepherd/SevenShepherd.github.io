In these incredibly worrying times, it has become evident that some in teaching positions are unable to distinguish between sound doctrine and systematic theology. As a Protestant leader committed to the truth of Scripture, it is essential to address this issue with clarity and compassion. Sound doctrine is the bedrock of our faith, derived directly from the Bible and centered on the core tenets of Christianity. Systematic theology, on the other hand, is the disciplined study and organization of these doctrines, helping believers understand the coherence and unity of biblical truths. Confusing these two not only muddles our understanding but also misleads those we are called to guide.

The current trend of conflating sound doctrine with systematic theology is not just an academic misstep but a spiritual danger. Sound doctrine is the essential truth that all believers must hold: the deity of Christ, the reality of the Trinity, the sufficiency of Scripture, and the necessity of grace for salvation. Systematic theology serves to deepen our understanding of these truths, organizing them into a comprehensive framework. When false teachers blur these lines, they often introduce personal interpretations and speculative ideas as if they were foundational truths, leading many astray. It is crucial to call out such errors and reaffirm our commitment to the clear, unambiguous teachings of the Bible.

In this context, fulfilling the Great Commission takes on renewed urgency. Christ called us to make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all He has commanded. This means we must ensure our teachings are rooted in sound doctrine, clearly distinguishing it from the valuable but distinct discipline of systematic theology. To the false teachers spreading confusion, I urge you to return to the simplicity and purity of the Gospel. Let us, as those truly called by Christ, uphold the truth with integrity and diligence, guiding others toward a genuine understanding of God's Word.
