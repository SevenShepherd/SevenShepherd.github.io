For those of you with this experience, I would encourage you to watch this video by [Dr. Michael S. Heiser<br>(Ph.D., Wisconsin)](https://www.youtube.com/@DRMSH) all the way through, even if the first part is difficult to hear, because the ultimate message is a reassuring one. Dr. Heiser was a master of ancient languages, specifically Old Testament Biblical Hebrew, and created the KJV, NIV, and NKJV Interlinears for Logos Bible Software.

    Christ‚Äôs sacrifice purifies the innermost being (Heb. 10:22). from dead works (Heb. 9:14).<sup><a href="#esvsb_cite">1</a></sup>

    > It is clear from the context that **the phrase ‚Äúdead works‚Äù are works that need to be repented from and thus are sins**. The same phrase occurs in Heb 9:14 in which the author of Hebrews states that our consciences need to be purified from them. As Bruce states, **they are works ‚Äúthat belong to the way of death and not the way of life‚Äù** (F. F. Bruce, Hebrews [NICNT], 138). &mdash; <a href="#net_cite">NET Bible: Full Notes Edition</a> <sup><a href="#net_cite">2</a></sup>

- <a name="defined" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.1.2 Repentance Defined</a>
    
    We know that the underlying meaning of the Koine Greek word for repentance is to *"feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense)"* according to the world's most authoritative Greek lexicons, otherwise every bible committe on earth wouldn't have chosen the english word for repentance which means the same thing. <sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup><sup> </sup><sup><a href="#BDAG">8</a></sup> At first glance this passage would seem to be saying that the form of repentance that is necessary for saving faith, is out of reach to those who have apostatized.

    > Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ. &mdash; <a href="#grudem">Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)</a>

    <!-- Pay attention to the phrase justification by faith alone. The concentration is on the justification that is by faith alone. When the reformers developed this from scripture they also believed that good works and obedience would naturally result from a true saving faith. As every historic protestant confession proves. -->

    Now that we understand the meaning of repentance, we can attempt to crack this difficult saying *"For it is impossible... to renew them again to repentance"*. Before I open up the other studies, It does seem to imply that they will not be able to feel sorrow or contrition for disobedience to God ever again and logically may even be hostile to the idea. This could possibly be speaking of the unpardonable sin (Mk 3:28-29). This group is in great danger.

    > Christians who fear that they may have committed the unpardonable sin show by their very anxiety that they have not done so. Persons who have committed it are unremorseful and unconcerned; indeed, they are ordinarily unaware of what they have done and to what fate they have sentenced themselves. &mdash; <a href="#packer">Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford). 88. UNPARDONABLE SIN - **Only Impenitence Cannot Be Forgiven**</a>

    It's important to understand that Repentance *"is a divine enablement"*<sup><a href="#demarest">11</a></sup> and not a human action. In fact it is the absence of action; once you were practicing sin (1Jn 3:9-10)<sup><a href="#esvsb_cite">1</a></sup>, now you're no longer *"living in a continual pattern"*<sup><a href="#esvsb_cite">1</a></sup> because God granted you a contrite heart (2Ti 2:25 NET) and genuine faith (Phil 1:29 NET; 2Cor. 13:5). The sinners prayer and walking down an aisle x amount of times, could however, be a work. Do not rely on your works for salvation, but on the Grace of God through faith.
    
    <!-- It is God who grants repentance (2Ti 2:25 NET) and faith (Phil 1:29 NET), so ask him. -->

<!-- I write this to all of you, incase there are those among you who have not repented. It is imperative that you get this understanding right. If you do not feel contrite enough to cease the actions that cause *"living in a continual pattern"* of sin <sup><a href="#esvsb_cite">1Jn 3:9-10</a></sup> (Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2; 1Jn 2:3-6, 3:9-10; 2Pe 2:21-22) then... there may not be a genuine profession of faith within you (2Cor. 13:5; Titus 1:16; Jas. 1:22 NLT; Is 29:13 NLT; Mt 15:8 NLT). If so, there's no better time than right now.

If you do feel contrite and are struggling but progressively winning your battle, you should breathe easy because you're seemingly going through sanctification -->

- <a name="Thorns and Thistles" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.2.1 Does Your Life Produce Only Thorns and Thistles?</a>
    
    Hebrews affirms that those who finally fall away may give many external signs of conversion and may look in many ways like Christians.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> This passage is an agricultural metaphor.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> Those who receive final judgement are compared to a land that bears no useful vegetation or useful fruit but rather bears thorns and thistles.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup>

    > When we recall the other metaphors in Scripture where good fruit is a sign of true spiritual life and **fruitlessness is a sign of false believers (for example, Matt. 3:8-10; 7:15-20; 12:33-35)**, we already have an indication that the author is speaking of people whose most trustworthy evidence of their spiritual condition (the fruit they bear) is negative ("thorns and thistles," v. 8), which would indicate that **the author is talking about people who are not genuinely Christians**. &mdash; <a href="#grudem">Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge)</a> <sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup>

    This metaphor bluntly indicates that those who fall away are like a land that never bore good fruit, even though their life received repeated blessings, *"rain that frequently falls on it"*. This is not the same as a land that once bore fruit and now does not, no, this is a land that never has and never will, *"thorns and thistles"*.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> This is not talking about people who are saved, but those who never were. We know this logically because we cannot lose our salvation, we are supernaturally preserved.

    <!-- The evidence for this contextually can be found in Heb. 6:9 when the author says *"we are convinced of **better things** relating to salvation."* The question is, better than what? The author is convinced that most of his readers have experienced better things than simply the partial and temporary influences of the Holy Spirit and the church talked about in v. 4-6.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> -->

- <a name="better things" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.2.2 Better Things Than What?</a>

    The real question is **‚Äúbetter things‚Äù than what?** The answer of course being **better things than simply the partial and temporary influences of the Holy Spirit and the church** talked about in verses 4 ‚Äì 6. So now we have identified the *good* things, what exactly are these *‚Äúbetter things‚Äù*? In addition to salvation (v. 9), they are things that give real evidence of salvation and reassures those who are genuine believers.:
    - Genuine fruit in their lives (v. 10)
    - Full assurance of hope (v. 11)
    - Saving faith, of those who inherit the promises (v. 12). 
        
<!-- > He says, ‚ÄúThough we speak thus, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation‚Äù (Heb. 6:9). But the question is **‚Äúbetter things‚Äù than what?** The plural ‚Äúbetter things‚Äù forms an appropriate contrast to the ‚Äúgood things‚Äù that have been mentioned in verses 4 ‚Äì 6: the author is convinced that most of his readers have experienced **better things than simply the partial and temporary influences of the Holy Spirit and the church** talked about in verses 4 ‚Äì 6.
>
What exactly are these ‚Äúbetter things‚Äù? In addition to salvation mentioned in verse 9, they are things that give real evidence of salvation ‚Äî genuine fruit in their lives (v. 10), full assurance of hope (v. 11), and saving faith, of the type exhibited by those who inherit the promises (v. 12). In this way he reassures those who are genuine believers ‚Äî those who show fruit in their lives and show love for other Christians, who show hope and genuine faith that is continuing at the present time, and who are not about to fall away. He wants to reassure these readers (who are certainly the great majority of the ones to whom he writes) while still issuing a strong warning to those among them who may be in danger of falling away.

> HEBREWS‚ÄîNOTE ON 6:1‚Äì2 elementary doctrine of Christ. Cf. ‚Äúbasic principles‚Äù (5:12). Three paired examples of doctrine are given: (1) Christian conversion through repentance (i.e., turning away) from works that cannot save and through faith in God (on faith, see 6:12; 10:22, 38‚Äì39; 12:2; 13:7; and ch. 11; on dead works, see 9:14); (2) washings (plural of Gk. baptismos), where the plural may refer to teaching about the differences between Jewish purification rites and Christian baptism, and laying on of hands, which could refer to an initiatory rite at the time of baptism (cf. Acts 8:14‚Äì17; 9:12, 17‚Äì19; 19:5‚Äì6) or to other hand-laying practices during prayers for healing and during commissioning of individuals for ministry (see notes on Luke 4:40; Acts 6:6; 9:17; 13:3); and (3) the believers‚Äô future hope of resurrection and the eternal judgment upon all people (see Heb. 9:27; 10:27; 11:19, 35).
>
HEBREWS‚ÄîNOTE ON 6:4‚Äì8 This passage has been subject to substantially different interpretations. The central debate concerns whether the descriptions of vv. 4‚Äì5 (e.g., ‚Äúenlightened,‚Äù ‚Äútasted the heavenly gift,‚Äù ‚Äúshared in the Holy Spirit,‚Äù ‚Äútasted of the goodness of the word of God‚Äù) depict people who were once true Christians. (1) Some argue these phrases do describe true Christians, implying that Christians can ‚Äúfall away‚Äù and lose their salvation (cf. note on 3:14, however, indicating a fundamental difficulty with this view). Nonetheless, most who advocate this view hold that some who backslide can still return to Christian faith, thus limiting 6:4‚Äì6 to hardened cases of apostasy in which it is ‚Äúimpossible ‚Ä¶ to restore them again to repentance‚Äù (vv. 4, 6). (2) Most argue, however, that although these people may have participated fully in the Christian covenantal community (where they experienced enlightened instruction in the Word of God, where they saw public repentance occur, and where the Holy Spirit was at work in powerful ways), when such people do ‚Äúfall away‚Äù it is clear that they are not true Christians because they have not made a true, saving response to the gospel, resulting in genuine faith, love, and perseverance (vv. 9‚Äì12). Significantly, they are like land that received much rain but bore no good fruit, only ‚Äúthorns and thistles‚Äù (v. 8). They may have participated outwardly in the Christian community and they even may have shared in the blessings of Christian fellowship; but, like the seed that fell on rocky ground in the parable of the sower, ‚Äúthey have no root‚Äù (Mark 4:17) and they ‚Äúfall away‚Äù when faced with persecution. (3) Another view is that the warnings are addressed to true believers, and though they will never completely fall away, the warnings are still the means that God uses to challenge them to persevere in their faith and so to preserve those whom the Lord has chosen. (4) A fourth view is that the ‚Äúfalling away‚Äù described in Heb. 6:6 has to do with loss of heavenly rewards. In any case, though the author recognizes that there may be a few in the congregation who fit the description of vv. 4‚Äì8, in general he does not think it to be true as a whole of the congregation to which he is writing, for he says, ‚Äúyet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things‚Äîthings that belong to salvation‚Äù (v. 9).

HEBREWS‚ÄîNOTE ON 6:4 For explains ‚Äúif God permits‚Äù (v. 3); in some cases it is fruitless to expound the deeper truths of the faith (or even lay again a foundation of elementary doctrines, v. 1), since it is impossible to restore some people again to repentance (cf. 12:15‚Äì17). This likely refers to persons who in the past may have participated in acts of public repentance, which were common in early Christian worship. Here, however, they have apparently ‚Äúfallen away‚Äù in such a decisive and irrevocable manner that ‚Äúthey are crucifying once again the Son of God ‚Ä¶ and holding him up to contempt‚Äù (6:6). Having committed such deliberate apostasy, it is impossible (at least from a human perspective) ‚Äúto restore‚Äù such a person ‚Äúagain to repentance.‚Äù While Christians understand these verses differently, it is wise pastoral advice to encourage a person who worries that he may have committed such a deep sin, that the very desire to repent and to be restored in fellowship with the Christian community is evidence that he has not ‚Äúfallen away‚Äù in the permanent, irrevocable way described in this verse (cf. note on ‚Äúblasphemy against the Holy Spirit‚Äù at Matt. 12:31‚Äì32). enlightened. Being listed first, this likely describes the initial entrance into Christian community through explanation of the Christian faith (cf. Heb. 10:32). Some have suggested that this may also have included baptism. Tasted the heavenly gift probably refers either (or both) to the Lord‚Äôs Supper or the general blessing that one encounters in the fellowship of the Christian community. have shared in (lit., ‚Äúhave become a partaker of‚Äù) the Holy Spirit. Some understand this as a reference to a person who has experienced the laying on of hands in the Christian community; others link it to the communal experience of the Spirit active in their midst producing fellowship and powerful wonders.
>
HEBREWS‚ÄîNOTE ON 6:5 tasted the goodness of the word of God. These people (see note on v. 4) have heard the truth explained and thus have also learned of God‚Äôs creative word (1:3; 11:3). This word will be fully exhibited in powers that bring about the world‚Äôs renewal in the age to come (2:5; 13:14), yet, through the present ministry of the Spirit, these powers are partially experienced now in the Christian community (cf. 2:4).
>
HEBREWS‚ÄîNOTE ON 6:6 Fallen away involves a sustained, committed rejection of Christ and a departure from the Christian community. To restore them again to repentance means to bring them once again to repent of their sins. This wording alone does not specify whether the earlier repentance was merely outward (cf. Luke 17:4), or whether it was a genuine, heartfelt repentance that accompanied true saving faith (see note on Heb. 6:4‚Äì8). The author is speaking in terms of what can be known from observing a person‚Äôs behavior. Crucifying once again graphically portrays rejection of Jesus. Holding ‚Ä¶ up to contempt (Gk. paradeigmatiz≈ç) conveys the idea of a public, shameful display. The warning of vv. 4‚Äì8 is substantial: such a falling away treats God‚Äôs own Son with such serious rejection that it is as if the person wanted again to put Christ on a cross; after such a departure there can be no return (though see note on v. 4).
>
HEBREWS‚ÄîNOTE ON 6:7‚Äì8 land that has drunk the rain. Drawing on a common agricultural metaphor used in the OT and NT alike (see esv cross-references on v. 7; also Matt. 13:24‚Äì30, 36‚Äì43; Luke 3:17), the author warns that those who fall away are like land that does not bear a crop that is useful, but only bears thorns and thistles. In a picture of impending final judgment and condemnation, the author says that such land is near to being cursed and its end is to be burned.
>
HEBREWS‚ÄîNOTE ON 6:9 Following the dire warning of vv. 4‚Äì8, the author expresses confidence in the salvation of his beloved audience (cf. 10:32‚Äì34, 39). Though he warns that some may fall away (6:4‚Äì8), he thinks that, generally speaking, his readers will not do this, for they have better things than those described in vv. 4‚Äì6; in fact, their lives give evidence of genuine spiritual renewal, for they have things that belong to salvation.
>
HEBREWS‚ÄîNOTE ON 6:10 Evidence is given for the author‚Äôs confidence in the salvation of his readers (v. 9; cf. 10:32‚Äì34), including the good fruit of their service (work) and the love of the saints (see 3:1; 13:24).
>
HEBREWS‚ÄîNOTE ON 6:11‚Äì12 The purpose of the warning (vv. 4‚Äì8), indeed of the whole letter, is to encourage earnest perseverance until the end. This demands hope, which is closely allied with faith (see 11:1; cf. 10:22), and enduring patience (cf. 6:15). For sluggish, see note on 5:11. imitators of those who ‚Ä¶ inherit the promises. Abraham is the immediate example in 6:13‚Äì15; other examples are found in ch. 11 (OT saints) and in 13:7 (church leaders). -->
