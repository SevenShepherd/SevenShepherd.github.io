The fruits of the faith are not the efforts of man, they're the workings of God (1Cor.3:6-7; Jn 15:4; Ga 5:22-23) upon closer union with Christ. Fruit-bearing is anti-legalistic by nature because it is post-justification. We must never tell a person that they must perform some action in order to merit salvation, for we know that justification is by faith only (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), instead, we would say that if their faith was truly genuine, and they were in fact saved, that their lives would bear the fruits of obedience (Mt 3:8;Jn 15:8,16). &ldquo;*Therefore Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify.*&rdquo;

A CHRISTIAN CHANGES RADICALLY
>
>> I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their
repentance by their deeds.
Acts 26:20
>
The New Testament word for repentance means changing one‚Äôs mind so
that one‚Äôs views, values, goals, and ways are changed and one‚Äôs whole life
is lived differently. The change is radical, both inwardly and outwardly;
mind and judgment, will and affections, behaviour and lifestyle, motives
and purposes, are all involved. Repenting means starting to live a new life.
>
The call to repent was the first and fundamental summons in the
preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2), Jesus (Matt. 4:17), the Twelve
(Mark 6:12), Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:38), Paul to the Gentiles (Acts
17:30; 26:20), and the glorified Christ to five of the seven churches in Asia
(Rev. 2:5, 16, 22; 3:3, 19). It was part of Jesus‚Äô summary of the gospel that
was to be taken to the world (Luke 24:47). It corresponds to the constant
summons of the Old Testament prophets to Israel to return to the God from
whom they had strayed (e.g. Jer. 23:22; 25:4‚Äì5; Zech. 1:3‚Äì6). Repentance is
always set forth as the path to remission of sins and restoration to God‚Äôs
favour, impenitence as the road to ruin (e.g. Luke 13:1‚Äì8).
>
Repentance is a fruit of faith, which is itself a fruit of regeneration. But
in actual life, repentance is inseparable from faith, being the negative aspect (faith is the positive aspect) of turning to Christ as Lord and Saviour. The idea that there can be saving faith without repentance, and that one can be justified by embracing Christ as Saviour while refusing him as Lord, is a destructive delusion. True faith acknowledges Christ as what he truly is, our God-appointed king as well as our God-given priest, and true trust in him as Saviour will express itself in submission to him as Lord also. To refuse this is to seek justification through an impenitent faith, which is no faith.
>
In repentance, says the Westminster Confession,
>> a sinner, out of the sight and sense not only of the danger, but also the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy nature, and righteous law of God; and upon the apprehension of his mercy in Christ to such as are penitent; so grieves for, and hates his sins, as to turn from them all unto God, purposing and endeavouring to walk with him in all ways of his commandments. (XV.2)
>
This statement highlights the fact that incomplete repentance, sometimes
called ‚Äòattrition‚Äô (remorse, self-reproach, and sorrow for sin generated by
fear of punishment, without any wish or resolve to forsake sinning), is
insufficient. True repentance is ‚Äòcontrition‚Äô, as modelled by David in Psalm
51, having at its heart a serious purpose of sinning no more but of living
henceforth a life that will show one‚Äôs repentance to be full and real (Luke
3:8; Acts 26:20). Repenting of any vice means going in the opposite
direction, to practise the virtues most directly opposed to it.

<a name="conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">2. Conclusion</a>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">Genuine faith always results in repentance.</span>

It's by simple observation, that we conclude, that saving faith &ldquo;results&rdquo; in obedience to God, &ldquo;after,&rdquo; we are justified, and that it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo; obedience. In other words, we do not repent to merit or earn our salvation, we repent because our faith is genuine and we have not made a false profession of faith (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4). 

<!-- those with genuine saving faith are granted to do so (Acts 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25). -->

> For we hold that one is justified by **faith apart from works** of the law. &mdash; Romans 3:28 ESV

> The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">he commands</span> all people everywhere to <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">repent</span>, &mdash; Acts 17:30 ESV

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">‚ÄúIf you love me,</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will obey my commandments</span>. &mdash; John 14:15 NET

> Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">his commandments</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">is a liar, and the truth is not in him</span>, &mdash; 1 John 2:4 ESV

<!-- Repentance ([turning from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/)) does not merit salvation, but  -->

A person who loves God will obey his commandment to repent (Ac 17:30; Jn 14:15,21). When a Christian does not repent ([inward resolve to turn from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/)), it brings into serious question, the validity of his faith.

<!-- 1. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** that they do not love God (Ac 17:30; Jn 14:15,21)
2. Those who do not repent will perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3 NLT)
3. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of false profession (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4)
4. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of not being led to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18)
5. Faith that does not &ldquo;result&rdquo; in repentance is not a faith (Jas 2:19) that leads to salvation (2Cor. 7:10). It is a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#living">dead faith</a>.
6. Why did Jesus come? (Lk 5:32) -->

<!-- Repentance is the fruit of [genuine saving faith](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-results/). Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (John 15:1-17).</span> -->

<!-- ## Faith Alone

This does not conflict with *Sola Fide* or &ldquo;Faith Alone&rdquo; because repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith; in fact this is the definition of *sola fide*. Saving faith "results" in (**not** &ldquo;includes&rdquo;) obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" (**not** merits) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). **It's post-justification.** Once you're already saved, someone who was genuine about their faith would desire to repent. This article is teaching dispositions of the heart post-justification.

- üêâ The Serpent says, *&ldquo;Surely you will not die&rdquo;* (Gen. 3:4 NET).
- üçá God says, *&ldquo;No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.&rdquo;* (Luke 13:3 ESV)
- üßë Repentance does not merit salvation, salvation produces repentance.

Repentance, obedience, and good works are all fruits of genuine saving faith. Fruits of already being saved; that's why we say they follow necessarily, because if the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10). I believe that no rational person could ever conclude that repentance is optional after reading the following evidences, and that is because <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">we don't control the fruit bearing process, <span style="font-size:1.2em;">God does</span></span>. -->

<!-- 
## Raw Logical Conclusions

This is how the logic looks without any effort to sugarcoat anything.

1. God commands that you repent (Ac 17:30) and those who say they "know God" but don't obey His commandments are liars and not living in the truth (1Jn 2:4).
2. Unless you repent you will die (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3).
3. Those who do not obey God's commandments do not love God (Jn 14:15,21) and God gave us the commandment to repent (Ac 17:30), so those who do not repent do not love God.
4. Those who do not repent do not want their sins forgiven (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10).
5. Those who do not repent do not want to be led to salvation (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18).
6. The consequences of failing to repent are disasterous (Re 2:5,16; 3:3; 16:9) -->

<!-- ## How We Should Preach Them

I don't think we should sugarcoat the gospel, but because we cannot see into a person's heart and because our knowledge is not complete as human beings, it's best to teach this as evidence instead of proof. A person could be justified but have zero assurance of salvation.


1. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** that they do not love God (Ac 17:30; Jn 14:15,21)
2. Those who do not repent will perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3 NLT)
3. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of false profession (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4)
4. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of not being led to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18)
5. Faith that does not &ldquo;result&rdquo; in repentance is not a faith (Jas 2:19) that leads to salvation (2Cor. 7:10). It is a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#living">dead faith</a>.
6. Why did Jesus come? (Lk 5:32) -->



<!-- Saving faith **does not include** obedience, saving faith **results in** obedience. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts but instead a trust and reliance in Christ. Genuine saving faith will always be accompanied by good works that come **after justification**. Good works and continuing to believe **follow** saving faith (*sola fide*). -->

<!-- To read more see [God Grants The Repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/god-grants-repentance/) and [The True Meaning Of Repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/), as well as [Theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#repentance). -->

- Repentance is **a turning away from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17; 1Jn 2:4).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5)

Saving faith <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;**does not include**&rdquo;</span> obedience, saving faith <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;**results in**&rdquo;</span> obedience. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts but instead a trust and reliance in Christ. Genuine saving faith will always be accompanied by good works that come <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;**after justification**&rdquo;</span>. Good works and continuing to believe <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;**follow**&rdquo;</span> saving faith (*sola fide*).

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:OrangeRed">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)

<!-- > "Faith that does not involve repentance is not true faith. It is not a faith that leads to salvation." &mdash; AMG Concise -->

<!-- Faith that does not &ldquo;result&rdquo; in repentance is not a faith (Jas 2:19) that leads to salvation, It is a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#living">dead faith</a>. Think about 2Cor. 7:10, when its says the repentance leads to salvation... are you saved? Then at some point to will have turned from your sins which would have been produced by a Godly contrition. Why did Jesus come? (Lk 5:32) -->

If the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10; James 2:14-26). This is the raw logical conclusion.

<!-- It could also mean that you're a very infantile Christian undergoing the initial stages of sanctification, maybe you lerned of God yesterday. -->

<!-- 5. The consequences of failing to repent are disasterous (Re 2:5,16; 3:3; 16:9) -->

<!-- 3. Those who do not repent are unforgiven? (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10) -->
