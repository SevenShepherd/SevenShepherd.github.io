<!-- tell them that if they are saved already, and their faith is genuine, that their lives would bear fruit (Mt 3:8;Jn 15:8,16). &ldquo;*Therefore Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify.*&rdquo; -->

<!-- The fruits of the faith are not the efforts of man, they're the workings of God (1Cor.3:6-7; Jn 15:4; Ga 5:22-23) upon closer union with Christ. Fruit-bearing is anti-legalistic by nature because it is post-justification. We must never tell a person that they must perform some action in order to merit salvation, for we know that justification is by faith only (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), instead, we would say that if their faith was truly genuine, and they were in fact saved, that their lives would bear the fruits of obedience (Mt 3:8;Jn 15:8,16). &ldquo;*Therefore Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify.*&rdquo;

<a name="C.S.Lewis" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">I. An excerpt from “The Perfect Penitent” in Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis</a>

> ... Now what was the sort of "hole" man had got himself into? He had tried to set up on his own, to behave as if he belonged to himself. In other words, fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: he is a rebel who must lay down his arms. Laying down your arms, surrendering, saying you are sorry, realising that you have been on the wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground floor—that is the only way out of a "hole." This process of surrender—this movement full speed astern—is what Christians call repentance. Now repentance is no fun at all.
>
> It is something much harder than merely eating humble pie. It means unlearning all the self-conceit and self-will that we have been training ourselves into for thousands of years. It means killing part of yourself, undergoing a kind of death. In fact, it needs a good man to repent. And here comes the catch. Only a bad person needs to repent: only a good person can repent perfectly. The worse you are the more you need it and the less you can do it. The only person who could do it perfectly would be a perfect person—and he would not need it.
>
> Remember, this repentance, this willing submission to humiliation and a kind of death, is not something God demands of you before He will take you back and which He could let you off if He chose: it is simply a description of what going back to Him is like. If you ask God to take you back without it, you are really asking Him to let you go back without going back. It cannot happen. Very well, then, we must go through with it. But the same badness which makes us need it, makes us unable to do it. Can we do it if God helps us? Yes, but what do we mean when we talk of God helping us? We mean God putting into us a bit of Himself, so to speak. He lends us a little of His reasoning powers and that is how we think: He puts a little of His love into us and that is how we love one another. When you teach a child writing, you hold its hand while it forms the letters: that is, it forms the letters because you are forming them. We love and reason because God loves and reasons and holds our hand while we do it.

> **60\. REPENTANCE**<br>
A CHRISTIAN CHANGES RADICALLY
>
>> I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their
repentance by their deeds.
Acts 26:20
>
The New Testament word for repentance means changing one’s mind so
that one’s views, values, goals, and ways are changed and one’s whole life
is lived differently. The change is radical, both inwardly and outwardly;
mind and judgment, will and affections, behaviour and lifestyle, motives
and purposes, are all involved. Repenting means starting to live a new life.
>
The call to repent was the first and fundamental summons in the
preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2), Jesus (Matt. 4:17), the Twelve
(Mark 6:12), Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:38), Paul to the Gentiles (Acts
17:30; 26:20), and the glorified Christ to five of the seven churches in Asia
(Rev. 2:5, 16, 22; 3:3, 19). It was part of Jesus’ summary of the gospel that
was to be taken to the world (Luke 24:47). It corresponds to the constant
summons of the Old Testament prophets to Israel to return to the God from
whom they had strayed (e.g. Jer. 23:22; 25:4–5; Zech. 1:3–6). Repentance is
always set forth as the path to remission of sins and restoration to God’s
favour, impenitence as the road to ruin (e.g. Luke 13:1–8).
>
Repentance is a fruit of faith, which is itself a fruit of regeneration. But
in actual life, repentance is inseparable from faith, being the negative aspect (faith is the positive aspect) of turning to Christ as Lord and Saviour. The idea that there can be saving faith without repentance, and that one can be justified by embracing Christ as Saviour while refusing him as Lord, is a destructive delusion. True faith acknowledges Christ as what he truly is, our God-appointed king as well as our God-given priest, and true trust in him as Saviour will express itself in submission to him as Lord also. To refuse this is to seek justification through an impenitent faith, which is no faith.
>
In repentance, says the Westminster Confession,
>> a sinner, out of the sight and sense not only of the danger, but also the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy nature, and righteous law of God; and upon the apprehension of his mercy in Christ to such as are penitent; so grieves for, and hates his sins, as to turn from them all unto God, purposing and endeavouring to walk with him in all ways of his commandments. (XV.2)
>
This statement highlights the fact that incomplete repentance, sometimes
called ‘attrition’ (remorse, self-reproach, and sorrow for sin generated by
fear of punishment, without any wish or resolve to forsake sinning), is
insufficient. True repentance is ‘contrition’, as modelled by David in Psalm
51, having at its heart a serious purpose of sinning no more but of living
henceforth a life that will show one’s repentance to be full and real (Luke
3:8; Acts 26:20). Repenting of any vice means going in the opposite
direction, to practise the virtues most directly opposed to it.

<a name="conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">III. Genuine faith always &ldquo;results&rdquo; in repentance.</a>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;"></span>

[**The true meaning of repentance**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) is **a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ**. Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Obedience does not merit salvation, the Holy Spirit produces obedience (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5, Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag), <span style="color:#00cc44;">Historic Protestant Position</span>.

Justification is by [faith alone](/assets/images/solas.jpg) (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.

<!-- It's by simple observation, that we conclude, that saving faith &ldquo;results&rdquo; in obedience to God, &ldquo;after,&rdquo; we are justified, and that it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo; obedience. In other words, we do not repent to merit or earn our salvation, we repent because our faith is genuine and we have not made a false profession of faith (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).  -->


<!-- those with genuine saving faith are granted to do so (Acts 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25). -->

<!-- > For we hold that one is justified by **faith apart from works** of the law. &mdash; Romans 3:28 ESV -->

> The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">he commands</span> all people everywhere to <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">repent</span>, &mdash; Acts 17:30 ESV
>> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">we can be sure</span> that we know him if we obey his commandments. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">If someone claims, “I know God,” but doesn’t obey God’s commandments, that person is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">a liar</span> and is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">not living in the truth</span>.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> But those who obey God’s word truly show how completely they love him. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">That is how we know we are living in him.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did. &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 NLT ([**article**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/))


<!-- > Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">his commandments</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">is a liar, and the truth is not in him</span>, &mdash; 1 John 2:4 ESV -->

<!-- Repentance ([turning from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/)) does not merit salvation, but  -->

A person who loves God will obey his commandment to repent (Ac 17:30; Jn 14:15,21). When a Christian does not repent ([inward resolve to turn from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/)), it brings into serious question, the validity of his faith. The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

<!-- 1. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** that they do not love God (Ac 17:30; Jn 14:15,21)
2. Those who do not repent will perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3 NLT)
3. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of false profession (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4)
4. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of not being led to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18)
5. Faith that does not &ldquo;result&rdquo; in repentance is not a faith (Jas 2:19) that leads to salvation (2Cor. 7:10). It is a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#living">dead faith</a>.
6. Why did Jesus come? (Lk 5:32) -->

<!-- Repentance is the fruit of [genuine saving faith](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-results/). Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (John 15:1-17).</span> -->

<!-- ## Faith Alone

This does not conflict with *Sola Fide* or &ldquo;Faith Alone&rdquo; because repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith; in fact this is the definition of *sola fide*. Saving faith "results" in (**not** &ldquo;includes&rdquo;) obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" (**not** merits) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). **It's post-justification.** Once you're already saved, someone who was genuine about their faith would desire to repent. This article is teaching dispositions of the heart post-justification.

- 🐉 The Serpent says, *&ldquo;Surely you will not die&rdquo;* (Gen. 3:4 NET).
- 🍇 God says, *&ldquo;No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.&rdquo;* (Luke 13:3 ESV)
- 🧑 Repentance does not merit salvation, salvation produces repentance.

Repentance, obedience, and good works are all fruits of genuine saving faith. Fruits of already being saved; that's why we say they follow necessarily, because if the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10). I believe that no rational person could ever conclude that repentance is optional after reading the following evidences, and that is because <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">we don't control the fruit bearing process, <span style="font-size:1.2em;">God does</span></span>. -->

<!-- 
## Raw Logical Conclusions

This is how the logic looks without any effort to sugarcoat anything.

1. God commands that you repent (Ac 17:30) and those who say they "know God" but don't obey His commandments are liars and not living in the truth (1Jn 2:4).
2. Unless you repent you will die (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3).
3. Those who do not obey God's commandments do not love God (Jn 14:15,21) and God gave us the commandment to repent (Ac 17:30), so those who do not repent do not love God.
4. Those who do not repent do not want their sins forgiven (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10).
5. Those who do not repent do not want to be led to salvation (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18).
6. The consequences of failing to repent are disasterous (Re 2:5,16; 3:3; 16:9) -->

<!-- ## How We Should Preach Them

I don't think we should sugarcoat the gospel, but because we cannot see into a person's heart and because our knowledge is not complete as human beings, it's best to teach this as evidence instead of proof. A person could be justified but have zero assurance of salvation.


1. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** that they do not love God (Ac 17:30; Jn 14:15,21)
2. Those who do not repent will perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3 NLT)
3. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of false profession (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4)
4. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of not being led to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18)
5. Faith that does not &ldquo;result&rdquo; in repentance is not a faith (Jas 2:19) that leads to salvation (2Cor. 7:10). It is a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#living">dead faith</a>.
6. Why did Jesus come? (Lk 5:32) -->



<!-- Saving faith **does not include** obedience, saving faith **results in** obedience. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts but instead a trust and reliance in Christ.
