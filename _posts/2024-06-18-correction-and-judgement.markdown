<a name="Judgement-Paradox" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">The Judgement Paradox</a>

[üëâüèº **Did Jesus really teach us not to judge? by Dr. Frank Turek (YouTube Short)**](https://youtube.com/shorts/DtVwpbNWwIo?si=haS97WkpVfXbqH1w)

The Bible has never taught us not to Judge rightly (John 7:24). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Purple;">*&ldquo;judge not&rdquo;* has become the anthem for a culture that loves sin more than God</span> and has been taken out of context by secular society and [unlearned lukewarm Christians](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/lukewarm/) who are allergic to scripture, resulting in a modern church that has become weak and [filled with sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/) (1Jn 3:6-10), and antinomianism (Jd 4 NET). 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> I meant that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">you are not to associate with</span> anyone who claims to be a believer<sup style="">[**a**]</sup> yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">Don‚Äôt even eat with such people.</span>
>
> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">It isn‚Äôt my responsibility to judge outsiders</span>, but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">God will judge those on the outside</span>; but as the Scriptures say, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">‚ÄúYou must remove the evil person from among you.‚Äù<sup style="">[**b**]</sup></span>
>
>&mdash; 1 Cor. 5:11-13 (**a.** 5:11 Greek a brother. **b.** 5:13 Deut 17:7.)

It is in fact our duty to maintain the purity of the church and the body of Christ and to rebuke and shun those who [pursue lifestyles of indulgent sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/). As the Apostle Paul says, do not eat with or even associate with people who claim they are Christian but give evidence that they have a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). This actually will help them change their lives and come to true contrite repentance and conversion. Do not enable them by withholding needed correction.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone has sin (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10 ESV), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10 ESV). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

>So watch yourselves!
>
><sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">‚ÄúIf another believer<sup style="">[**a**]</sup> sins, rebuke that person</span>; then <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">if there is repentance, forgive.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Even if that person wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness, you must forgive.‚Äù

>&mdash; Luke 17:3-4 (**a.** Greek If your brother)

In fact the most unloving and hateful thing you can ever do to a Christian brother or sister in Christ, is to withhold correction, when correction, rebuking, and judgement is needed to wake them up; however, **be careful that you are not confusing this healthy correction, with godless slander (Proverbs 10:18; 20:19; Psalm 101:5) or attacks on the individual**, this is an entirely different matter. We are not to hate (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10,14-15; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35), or attack.

> 24 A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people. 25 Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people‚Äôs hearts, and they will learn the truth. 
>
>&mdash; 2 Timothy 2:24-25

This is one of the most common misconceptions of all time. Even Christians who have had faith for many years do not understand this and this is because they have kneeled to secular society in weakness and they lack scriptural knowledge. **Attacking and disparaging people is wrong**, but judging rightly and giving proper correction, is not only good, it is your responsibility.

The article presents an interpretation of Scripture that emphasizes the importance of righteous judgment within the Christian community, particularly regarding believers who persist in sinful behavior. It highlights the often-misunderstood concept of "judge not" from Matthew 7:1 and contrasts it with the directive to judge rightly in John 7:24. Let's break down some of the key points with a scriptural analysis:

1. **Judging Rightly (John 7:24):**
   - **Scripture:** "Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment."
   - **Interpretation:** This verse emphasizes the need for discernment and making judgments based on righteousness rather than superficial appearances. The article correctly points out that Jesus calls for judging rightly, not a blanket prohibition against all forms of judgment.

2. **Cultural Misinterpretation of "Judge Not":**
   - **Scripture:** "Judge not, that you be not judged." (Matthew 7:1)
   - **Interpretation:** The article asserts that this verse has been taken out of context, often used to avoid any form of moral accountability. In context, Matthew 7:1-5 speaks against hypocritical judgment rather than all judgment, advising believers to address their own sins before judging others.

3. **Responsibility to Judge Within the Church (1 Corinthians 5:11-13):**
   - **Scripture:** "But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler‚Äînot even to eat with such a one... Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? God judges those outside. 'Purge the evil person from among you.'"
   - **Interpretation:** The article correctly cites Paul‚Äôs instruction that church members are responsible for maintaining the purity of the church by judging those within the community who persist in sin. This aligns with the directive to uphold moral standards within the Christian fellowship.

4. **Correction and Repentance (Luke 17:3-4):**
   - **Scripture:** "Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him."
   - **Interpretation:** The article emphasizes the need for correction and forgiveness, highlighting that rebuking a sinning believer is an act of love intended to bring about repentance and restoration.

5. **Avoiding Slander and Hatred (Various Verses):**
   - **Scripture:** "A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness." (2 Timothy 2:24-25)
   - **Interpretation:** The article differentiates between righteous judgment and malicious behavior, advocating for correction done in love and gentleness, not in a spirit of hatred or slander.

**Conclusion:**
The article's interpretation aligns with a traditional understanding of biblical teaching on judgment, correction, and church discipline. It emphasizes the need for righteous judgment and correction within the Christian community while avoiding hypocritical, superficial, or malicious behavior. This perspective encourages believers to uphold moral standards in a manner consistent with scriptural directives, ensuring that correction is carried out with the intention of fostering repentance and spiritual growth.

Overall, this interpretation is consistent with the biblical texts cited, promoting a balanced approach to judgment and correction that seeks to maintain the purity and integrity of the Christian community.
