[👉🏼 **Did Jesus really teach us not to judge? by Dr. Frank Turek (YouTube Short)**](https://youtube.com/shorts/DtVwpbNWwIo?si=haS97WkpVfXbqH1w)

The Bible has never taught us not to Judge rightly (John 7:24). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Purple;">*&ldquo;judge not&rdquo;* has become the anthem for a culture that loves sin more than God</span> and has been taken out of context by secular society and [unlearned lukewarm Christians](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/lukewarm/) who are allergic to scripture, resulting in a modern church that has become weak and [filled with sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/) (1Jn 3:6-10), and antinomianism (Jd 4 NET).

It is in fact our duty to maintain the purity of the church and the body of Christ and to rebuke and shun those who [pursue lifestyles of indulgent sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/). As the Apostle Paul says, do not eat with or even associate with people who claim they are Christian but give evidence that they have a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). This actually will help them change their lives and come to true contrite repentance and conversion. Do not enable them by withholding needed correction.

ℹ️ Disclaimer: Everyone has sin (1 Jn 1:8–10 ESV), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10 ESV). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

>So watch yourselves!

><sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">“If another believer<sup style="">[**a**]</sup> sins, rebuke that person</span>; then <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">if there is repentance, forgive.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Even if that person wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness, you must forgive.”

>&mdash; Luke 17:3-4 (**a.** Greek If your brother)

In fact the most unloving and hateful thing you can ever do to a Christian brother or sister in Christ, is to withhold correction, when correction, rebuking, and judgement is needed to wake them up; however, **be careful that you are not confusing this healthy correction, with godless slander (Proverbs 10:18; 20:19; Psalm 101:5) or attacks on the individual**, this is an entirely different matter. We are not to hate (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10,14-15; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35), or attack.

> 24 A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people. 25 Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people’s hearts, and they will learn the truth. 
>
>&mdash; 2 Timothy 2:24-25

This is one of the most common misconceptions of all time. Even Christians who have had faith for many years do not understand this and this is because they have kneeled to secular society in weakness and they lack scriptural knowledge. **Attacking and disparaging people is wrong**, but judging rightly and giving proper correction, is not only good, it is your responsibility.
