## Angels Worship Jesus As God

Jesus never rebuked any Angel or any of His followers for worshiping Him and yet worship of anything or anyone other than God is absolutely forbidden in the Bible.

<!-- > And Jesus answered and said to him, **“It is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’”** &mdash; Luke 4:8 LSB -->

> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. &mdash; Luke 4:8 KJV

`Highly Idiomatic Translation / Paraphrase`
- Critical Text
    > Going through a long line of prophets, God has been addressing our ancestors in different ways for centuries. Recently he spoke to us directly through his Son. By his Son, God created the world in the beginning, and it will all belong to the Son at the end. This Son perfectly mirrors God, and is stamped with God’s nature. He holds everything together by what he says—powerful words! After he finished the sacrifice for sins, the Son took his honored place high in the heavens right alongside God, far higher than any angel in rank and rule. Did God ever say to an angel, “You’re my Son; today I celebrate you” or “I’m his Father, he’s my Son”? When he presents his honored Son to the world, he says, **“All angels must worship him.”** &mdash; Hebrews 1:6 MSG (The Message)

## Conclusion

✔️ **The Angels Worship Jesus As God, there is ZERO doubt!**

🚫 <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#C00000;">BEWARE:</span> the cultists known as Jehovah Witnesses. They have stripped the correct translation of [proskuneo as worship and mutilated it only where it concerns Jesus](https://carm.org/jehovahs-witnesses/the-new-world-translation-and-proskuneo-worship/). Unsurprisingly, they left the proper translation as worship when concerning the devil and demons; this showcases who their true master is.

⚠️ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#E8AA00;">Warning:</span> The cults will often attack the word firstborn ([πρωτότοκος (prōtotokos)](https://biblehub.com/greek/4416.htm)) and attempt to twist it to mean "first created" in a feeble attempt to strip Jesus of his deity. This is why it's important to understand the underlying meaning in koine greek. Take for instance Colossians 1:15:

> “He [Jesus] is the image of the invisible God, the **firstborn** over all creation.”

Greek Scholars, unsurprisingly, disagree with the cults and have proven that the word Paul uses here in Colossians 1:15 (prototokos) means: <span style="font-style:italic;color:Green;">superior, preeminent in rank, and above</span>. The word “firstborn” is the Greek word “prototokos.” It does not mean “first created” as the cults say. There’s another Greek word for ‘first created’ (protoktistos) and Paul did not use that word.

📖 **Context:** The context makes that clear. And that’s why it’s so important to always examine the context and allow Scripture to interpret Scripture. Why is Jesus superior over all creation? Well, the very next verse explains, that Jesus is superior to everything, because He is the One who made everything!

> 16 “For by Him [Jesus] **all things** [How many things? ALL THINGS] were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. **All things** were created through Him and for Him. 17 And He is before **all things**, and in Him **all things** consist.” &mdash; Colossians 1:16-17

⚠️ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#E8AA00;">Warning:</span> To deal with the implications of these two verses (Col. 1:16–17) the cults added four words ("other") into their false bible translation that are not in the original Greek to give people the impression that Jesus only made some things—not ALL things. 

Miraculously, these cultists didn't destroy the entire bible and we find that Col. 1:16–17 is corroborated by John 1:1-3,14 in their own corrupted texts.

> “In the beginning was the Word [Jesus], and the Word [Jesus] was with God, and the Word [Jesus] was God. 2 He [Jesus] was in the beginning with God. 3 **All things were made through Him [Jesus]**, and without Him [Jesus] nothing was made that was made... 14 And the Word [Jesus] became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His [Jesus] glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.”

Ask the cults the following:

- In Col 1:15-17, why did you insert the word "other" 4 times even though it is not in the original Greek? How would these verses read if the word "other" had not been inserted? What does scripture say about adding words to the Bible (Proverbs 30:5-6)?

	> Every word of God is tested;
	He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
	6 **Do not add to His words
	Lest He reprove you, and you be proved a liar**.

- **Is Jesus the creator?** They will likey respond: “Well, we believe Jesus is a creator in a sense. After God created Jesus, Jesus helped God create the other things.” Tell them to read Isaiah 44:24. Notice what it says:

	> “Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, “I, the LORD [YHWH], am the maker of **all things**, stretching out the heavens [How? With someone else’s help? No.] **by Myself**, and spreading out the earth [with help? No.] **all alone**.”

	- Jn 1:3 says that Jesus created "all things", but in Isa 44:24, God says that he "by myself created the heavens and the earth" and asks the question "Who was with me?" when the heavens and the earth were created. How can this be since if Jesus had been created by God, then he would have been with God when everything else was created?

	- Jn 1:3 says in reference to Christ, "All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence". How could Christ have been a created being if ALL things came into existence through him? If Jesus was a created being, then according to Jn 1:3, Jesus would have had to create himself.

	- Col 1:16, in talking about Jesus, says that"... All [other] things have been created through him and FOR HIM". If Jesus were Michael the Archangel at the time of creation, would an angel have created all things for himself? Isa 43:7 says God created "everyone ... for my OWN glory ..."

		> Everyone who is called by My name,
		And whom I have created **for My glory**,
		Whom I have formed, even whom I have made.”

So, if the cults try to tell you that the term “firstborn” means Jesus was the first being God created, gently tell them that they’re mistaken and that the passage (Colossians 1:15) is actually teaching that Jesus is superior or above all creation, because Jesus is the Creator.
