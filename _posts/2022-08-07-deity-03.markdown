- NET Bible Translator Notes
    
    > i. John 8:58 NET sn **I am! is an explicit claim to deity.** Although each occurrence of the phrase “I am” in the Fourth Gospel needs to be examined individually in context to see if an association with Exod 3:14 NET is present, it seems clear that **this is the case here** (as the response of the Jewish authorities in the following verse shows).

    > 54-56 Jesus said, “If I were striving to get all the attention, it wouldn’t amount to anything. But my Father, the same One you say is your Father, put me here at this time and place of splendor. You haven’t recognized him in this. But I have. If I, in false modesty, said I didn’t know what was going on, I would be as much of a liar as you are. But I do know, and I am doing what he says. **Abraham—your ‘father’—with elated faith looked down the corridors of history and saw my day coming. He saw it and cheered.”**

## Conclusion

Jesus declared Himself to be the Great “I AM” (John 8:56-59), the Old Testament name for God. He's saying that He is the God of the Old Testament Yahweh!.

> 14 And God said to Moses, **“I AM WHO I AM”;** and He said, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, **‘I AM has sent me to you.’”**<br>
15 
And God furthermore said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, **‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’** This is My name forever, and this is My memorial-name from generation to generation.<br>
16 
Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, **‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me**, saying, “I indeed care about you and what has been done to you in Egypt. &mdash; Exodus 3:14-16 LSB

The Jews tried to kill him over it! Notice that the reaction of the Jews to Jesus calling himself God, are in accordance with Lev 24:16. It was understood that Jesus was claiming to be the I AM, the Jews took it as blasphemy.

> 59 Therefore **they picked up stones to throw at Him**, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple. &mdash; John 8:59 LSB

> Moreover, the one who **blasphemes** the name of Yahweh shall surely be put to death; **all the congregation shall certainly stone him**. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death. &mdash; Leviticus 24:16 LSB

Further, this didn't happen just once, but many times.

> For this reason therefore **the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him**, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, **making Himself equal with God.** &mdash; John 5:18 LSB

> 30 **I and the Father are one.”** 31 **The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him.** 32 Jesus answered them, “I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?” 33 The Jews answered Him, “For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and **because You, being a man, make Yourself God.**” &mdash; John 10:30-33 LSB

⚠️ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#E8AA00;">Warning:</span> the cults have changed the scholarly greek translation of "I AM" to "i have been". In Greek, the words recorded in John 8:58 are “‘prin abraam genesthai ego eimi.” Literally, this is “Before Abraham was existing, I am.” “Ego eimi” is literally, “I am.” This is the **present tense**. To say “I have been” is to use the **perfect tense**. In Greek, he would have been “aemane,” but Jesus didn’t use it here. **He used the present tense “ego eimi” which is “I am.”**

***Conclusion: Not only did Jesus call himself (Yahweh) God, but the reaction of the Jews proves this is the case. It is plainly stated, that they understood that Jesus was "making himself out to be God".***

    ❔ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3f33e8;">Questions For The Cults:</span> In Rev 22:12-13, Jesus Christ, the one who is "coming quickly", says of himself," I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end". In Rev 1:17-18, Jesus, the one who "became dead, but, look! I am living forever and ever", refers to himself as the first and the last. Rev 21:6, in speaking of God, says, "...I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end .,.". God is also referred to as the "first" and the "last" in Isa 44:6 and Isa 48:12. How can this be since by definition of these words there can only be one first and one last?

    - Revelation 1:17-18 LSB
    > And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, “Do not fear; **I am the first and the last**, 18 and the living One; **and I was dead**, and behold, I am alive forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.

> Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” 9 Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you all so long and have you not come to know Me, Philip? **He who has seen Me has seen the Father**; how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?

When a word is italicized in the Bible, that means it does not appear in the original Greek MSS (Manuscripts). Since quoting the Bible here in my blog causes all the words to become italicized, i've put words that don't appear in the Greek within brackets.

- John 8:24 LSB
> Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am [He], you will die in your sins.”

- John 8:28 LSB
> So Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am [He], and I do nothing from Myself, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me.

    In this context there is an implied predicate nominative (“he”) following the “I am” phrase. What Jesus’ hearers had to acknowledge is that he was who he claimed to be, i.e., the Messiah (cf. 20:31). This view is also reflected in English translations like NIV (“if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be”), NLT (“unless you believe that I am who I say I am”), and CEV (“if you don’t have faith in me for who I am”). For a different view that takes this “I am” and the one in 8:28 as nonpredicated (i.e., absolute), see R. E. Brown, John (AB), 1:533-38. Such a view sees the nonpredicated “I am” as a reference to the divine Name revealed in Exod 3:14, and is reflected in English translations like NAB (“if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins”) and TEV (“you will die in your sins if you do not believe that ‘I Am Who I Am’”) 

- John 13:19 LSB
> From now on I am telling you before it occurs, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am [He].

- John 18:4-8 LSB
> So Jesus, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, “Whom do you seek?” 5 They answered Him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He said to them, “**I am** He.” And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them. 6 So when He said to them, “**I am** He,” **they drew back and fell to the ground**. 7 Therefore He again asked them, “Whom do you seek?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.” 8 Jesus answered, “I told you that **I am** He; so if you seek Me, let these go their way,”

    >> Yeshua, who knew everything that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, “Whom do you want?” 5 “Yeshua from Natzeret,” they answered. He said to them, **“I AM.”** Also standing with them was Y’hudah, the one who was betraying him. 6 When he said, **“I AM,”** **they went backward from him and fell to the ground**. 7 So he inquired of them once more, “Whom do you want?” and they said, “Yeshua from Natzeret.” 8 “I told you, **‘I AM,’**” answered Yeshua, “so if I’m the one you want, let these others go.”  -->
