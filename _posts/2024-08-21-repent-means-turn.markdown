This is undeniable proof using scripture alone, that a turning away from sin was what Jesus meant in Matt. 4:17 when he said *"Repent."*

> When God raised up his servant, Jesus, he sent him <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">first</span> to you people of Israel, to bless you by <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">turning each of you back from your sinful ways</span>. &mdash; Acts 3:26

<!-- As you can see, the Apostle Peter himself, the rock on which the church was built, has taken to my defense on this issue and against those who falsely teach assent changes in the mind.  -->

What was Jesus' <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">first</span> fundamental summons? It was to Repent, found in Matt. 4:17.

> From that time Jesus <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">began</span> to preach this message: “<span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">Repent</span>, for the kingdom of heaven is near!” &mdash; Matthew 4:17 NET

**God has spoken.** The Apostles have written. The only question is, will you receive their correction? Do not listen to false teachers who tell you that repentance is only a mind change.

> Now repent of your sins and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped away. &mdash; Acts 3:19

The message that <span style="font-style:italic;">&ldquo;There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.&rdquo;</span> should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

<!-- It's most fascinating that Jesus describes [New Testament repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Mt 11:21-22) <a href="#GPT-4-Turbo">in the same way</a> the Old Testament does (Job 42:6).  -->

- Not justifying (Rom 3:28; Eph 2:8-10).
- Imperfect (1Jn 1:8–10; 2:1-2).
- **Taught alongside faith by Christ Himself** (Mark 1:14-15).
- One of the reasons Jesus came (Lk 5:32).
- Taught as [**an inward resolve to turn from sin**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Ac 3:19,26; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
- **An immediate fruit** of genuine saving faith resulting in good works and righteous behavior (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5).
- **Will happen** in genuine believers (1Jn 3:6-10). logically (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
- **Commanded** by God (Ac 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- **Granted** by God (Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25).
- Growth **given** by God (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5).
- Preached **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- **Produced from Godly sorrow** (2 Cor. 7:10; Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- **Leading to salvation** and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Described as **needed** and necessary (Lk 15:7).
- Repent or Perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Unrepentant sin not tolerated by the Apostles and not a one time event (Lk 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:11-13). 

[The world's most authoritative Greek lexicons](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) show that the true meaning of [metanoéō](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [metánoia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) falls under the second meaning of &ldquo;*feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense)*&rdquo; as taught by Christ & The Apostles (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).

<!-- > The call to repent was the first and fundamental summons in the preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2), Jesus (**Matt. 4:17**), the Twelve (Mark 6:12), Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:38), Paul to the Gentiles (Acts 17:30; 26:20), and the glorified Christ to five of the seven churches in Asia (Rev. 2:5, 16, 22; 3:3, 19). It was part of Jesus’ summary of the gospel that was to be taken to the world (Luke 24:47).

<!-- Just because justification is by fath alone doesn't mean we cast a blind eye on what regeneration looks like.

scripture has identified those who practice sin as not true born agains.

instead of arguing with God, lets try to understand it

you cant have a god inside of you and there not be a cause and effect
there will be changes in your lifestyle brought on by the holy spirit

why teachers who teach osas are destroying your children, and making you complicit in their destruction

obersvations of sanctification are never legalisitc  -->

<!-- Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**. -->
