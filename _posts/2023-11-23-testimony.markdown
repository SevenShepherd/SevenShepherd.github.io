Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand (Ac 3:19; Mt 3:8; 4:17). If you do not wake up you will die (Rev 3:3; Lk 13:3). Repentance does not merit salvation, but a person who loves God will obey his commandments (Jn 14:15; Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4) and I believe will be enabled to desire to do so.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it. <span style="font-weight:bold;"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> then he opens the ears of men and terrifies<sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2033%3A14-28&version=ESV;NET;EXB">[c]</a></sup> them with warnings,</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man; <sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> “Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> and he is merciful to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom; <sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor’; <span style="font-weight:bold;"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> then man<sup></sup> prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> He sings before men and says: ‘I sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.’ &mdash; [Job 33:14-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2033%3A14-28&version=ESV;NET;EXB), Elihu Disagrees With Job’s View of God.
