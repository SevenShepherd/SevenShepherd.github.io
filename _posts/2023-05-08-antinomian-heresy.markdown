<!-- An antinomian and heretical theology is one that perverts God's grace by turning it into a license for sin, and its promoters are marked out for condemnation. -->

<!-- Theological Liberalism Is The Antithesis of Christianity And Openly An Antinomian Heresy -->

<!-- Atheists: You don't have an intellectual objection to Christianity‚Äîyou have an emotional, moral, or volitional objection. -->

<!-- Christ (Matthew 7:21-23). Jesus warned that false teachers would come in his name to lead people astray (Matthew 24:5, 24). False Christianity is exactly what you would expect to see if real Christianity is true. It is what Jesus predicted! -->

Jude calls the church to defend the truth aggressively against this infiltration. Pay careful attention to the striking condemnation from Jude in this passage. The main points being the identifying points. The individuals who are marked out for condemnation meet the following criteria:

1. They pervert, twist, and distort the gospel, falsely teaching that our God's grace allows them to live immoral lives. The NET Bible nails it with the phrase *"turned the grace of our God into **a license for evil**."* Greek [‚Äúdebauchery.‚Äù](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%204&version=NET) This is the same word Peter uses to predict what the false teachers will be like (2 Pet 2:2, 7, 18).
2. The phrase *"deny Jesus as Master and Lord"* is eerily reminiscent of modern neotheologies of today. They use the gospel to teach that grace is an excuse for ungodly living (cf. Rom. 3:8; 6:1, 15; 2 Pet. 3:15‚Äì16). Some even claiming you don't need to accept Jesus as Master & Lord to be saved!

The Bible describes these ungodly men as worming (Jude 4 NLT) their way into churches (i.e. subversive) to preach and teach destructive heresies, even to the point of denying the Master who bought them. They lead and apparently teach debauched lifestyles, they commercialize Christianity like many of the false health & wealth prosperity gospel teachers.

As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">many will follow their <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">debauched lifestyles</span></span>.

No one should ever teach that you will remain in sin after you are saved! True saving faith always & naturally results in obedience to God after justification. It is true that sanctification is progressive, and over time you will grow in your Christian walk; however, you won't regress or live a lifestyle of indulgent sin, you will progress in holiness. *"God justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify."*

> "When someone is brought to faith by the Holy Spirit, he undergoes a conversion. His life turns around. This turning around is called ‚Äúrepentance,‚Äù and it is an immediate fruit of genuine faith." &mdash; [Dr. R. C. Sproul](https://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q) (Ph.D., Whitefield), <a href="https://amzn.to/3m2RPXR">Everyone's a Theologian, Part Six: Soteriology. Chapter 42: Saving Fath.</a>

There's an enormous difference between practicing sin which is living in a lifelong continual pattern (lifestyle), and struggling against sin with decreasing patterns of sin (1 John 3:8‚Äì9; cf. Rom. 6:14‚Äì18).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> What shall we say then? <span style="font-weight:bold;">Are we to remain in sin</span> so that grace may increase? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Absolutely not!</span> How can we who died to sin still live in it? &mdash; Romans 6:1-2 NET

Christianity is a call to discipleship. Let us not be liars by throwing out morality and abusing the grace of our God! This conclusion is not optional, never was, and never will be.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">If someone claims, ‚ÄúI know God,‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt obey God‚Äôs commandments, <span style="color:orangered;">that person is a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">liar</span> and is not living in the truth</span>.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> But those who **obey** God‚Äôs word truly show how completely they love him. **That is how we know** we are living in him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.</span> &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 [NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A36%3B+1Jn+2%3A3-6&version=ESV;NET;NLT)

<!-- 6 Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? 2 Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it? -->

All theologians agree on this verse below, from the most academically sound and historically time-tested theologies known to Christendom (i.e. Reformed theology), to minority views. If you are engaging in a lifelong continual practice of sin, an indulgent lifestyle of sin, the Bible says that you do not belong to God.

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Those who have been born into God‚Äôs family do not make a practice of sinning, because God‚Äôs life is in them. So they can‚Äôt keep on sinning, because they are children of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> So **now we can tell who are children of God and who are children of the devil**. Anyone who does not live righteously and does not love other believers does not belong to God.  -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed: to destroy the works of the devil. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Everyone who has been fathered by God does not practice sin, because God‚Äôs seed resides in him, and thus he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> By this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed: Everyone who does not practice righteousness‚Äîthe one who does not love his fellow Christian‚Äîis not of God. &mdash; 1 Jn 3:8-10 NET

If this antinomian heresy is what your teachers are teaching, or what you're teaching your loved ones. YOU ARE IN GRAVE DANGER! CEASE IMMEDIATELY!

> ... They will consider nothing sacred. They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good. They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">They will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">act religious</span>, but they will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">reject the power that could make them godly</span>. Stay away from people like that!</span> &mdash; 2 Timothy 3:2-5b

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">It would be better if they had never known the way to righteousness than to know it and then reject the **command** they were given <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">to live a</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">holy life</span>.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> They prove the truth of this proverb: <span style="font-weight:bold;">‚ÄúA dog returns to its vomit.‚Äù</span> And another says, ‚ÄúA washed pig returns to the mud.‚Äù &mdash; 2 Peter 2:21-22 NLT

All sins can be forgiven men except [blasphemy against the Holy Spirit](https://carm.org/about-the-holy-spirit/what-is-blasphemy-of-the-holy-spirit/) (Matt. 12:31-32; Mk 3:28‚Äì29; Heb. 6:4-8; 10:26-31).

<!-- > ‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin‚Äù &mdash; Mark 3:28‚Äì29 ESV -->

> Christians who fear that they may have committed the unpardonable sin show by their very anxiety that they have not done so. Persons who have committed it are unremorseful and unconcerned; indeed, they are ordinarily unaware of what they have done and to what fate they have sentenced themselves. &mdash; <a href="#packer">Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford). 88. UNPARDONABLE SIN - **Only Impenitence Cannot Be Forgiven**</a>

It should be clear that any theology that turns the Grace of our God into a license to sin is antinomian, heretical, and marked out for condemnation.

<!-- <span style="font-size:30px;">ü´∂</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:25px;color:Black;">Your mistake is that you don‚Äôt know the Scriptures</span> -->

<!-- Scripture alone (*Sola Scriptura*) sure is nailed down quite nicely by Jesus words in Mark 12:24, and is somewhat eerily reminiscent of Hosea 4:6 *"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge"*. While the contexts are separate, the message is the same, scripture begets knowledge, and knowledge prevents death. -->
