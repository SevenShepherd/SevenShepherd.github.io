<!-- Any Theology That Turns The Grace Of Our God Into A License For Sin Is Antinomian, Heretic, And Marked Out For Condemnation. -->

<!-- An antinomian and heretical theology is one that perverts God's grace by turning it into a license for sin, and its promoters are marked out for condemnation. -->

<!-- Theological Liberalism Is The Antithesis of Christianity And Openly An Antinomian Heresy -->

<!-- Atheists: You don't have an intellectual objection to Christianity—you have an emotional, moral, or volitional objection. -->

<!-- Christ (Matthew 7:21-23). Jesus warned that false teachers would come in his name to lead people astray (Matthew 24:5, 24). False Christianity is exactly what you would expect to see if real Christianity is true. It is what Jesus predicted! -->

<!-- <span style="font-size:25px;">🫶</span> <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">Jesus replied, “Your mistake is that you don’t know the Scriptures, and you don’t know the power of God.</span> -->

<!-- *"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you... I also will forget your children."*  -->

I want you to pay attention to the beautiful condemnation from Jude in this passage. Jude calls the church to defend the truth aggressively against this infiltration. The main points being the identifying points. The individuals who are marked out for condemnation meet the following criteria: 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> I say this because some **ungodly people have <span style="font-size:21px;color:darksalmon;">wormed</span> their way into your churches, saying that God’s marvelous grace allows us to live immoral lives**. The condemnation of such people was recorded long ago, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">for they have denied our only <span style="font-size:21px;color:red;">Master and Lord</span>, Jesus Christ</span>. &mdash; Jude 1:4 NLT

1. They pervert, twist, and distort the gospel, falsely teaching that our God's grace allows them to live immoral lives. The NET Bible nails it with the phrase *"turned the grace of our God into **a license for evil**."* Greek [“debauchery.”](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%204&version=NET) This is the same word Peter uses to predict what the false teachers will be like (2 Pet 2:2, 7, 18).
2. They deny Jesus as Master and Lord. Some neotheologies today are reminiscent of this. They use the gospel to teach that grace is an excuse for ungodly living (cf. Rom. 3:8; 6:1, 15; 2 Pet. 3:15–16). Some even claiming you don't need to accept Jesus as Master & Lord to be saved!

<!-- > 24 Jesus replied, “Your mistake is that you don’t know the Scriptures, and you don’t know the power of God. -->

The Bible describes these ungodly men as worming their way into churches (i.e. subversive) to preach and teach damnable heresies, even denying the Lordship of Christ. They lead and apparently teach debauched lifestyles, they commercialize Christianity like many of the false health & wealth prosperity gospel teachers.

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> But false prophets also arose among the people, just as **there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies**, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">even denying the <span style="font-size:21px;color:red;">Master</span> who bought them</span>, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. &mdash; 2 Peter 2:1 -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But false prophets arose among the people,<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[a]</span> just as <span style="font-weight:bold;">there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[b]</span> will<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[c]</span> infiltrate your midst<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[d]</span> with destructive heresies,<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[e]</span></span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">even to the point of<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[f]</span> denying the <span style="font-size:21px;color:red;">Master</span> who bought them</span>. As a result, they will bring<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[g]</span> swift destruction on themselves. 2 And many will follow their <span style="font-weight:bold;">debauched lifestyles</span>.<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[h]</span> Because of these false teachers,<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[i]</span> the way of truth will be slandered.<span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[j]</span> &mdash; [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET)

No one should ever teach you that it is alright to remain in sin once you're saved! It is true that sanctification is progressive; however, *"When someone is brought to faith by the Holy Spirit, he undergoes a conversion. His life turns around. This turning around is called “repentance,” and it is an immediate fruit of genuine faith."* You will not regress, you will in fact progress. *"God justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify."*

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> What shall we say then? <span style="font-weight:bold;">Are we to remain in sin</span> so that grace may increase? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Absolutely not!</span> How can we who died to sin still live in it? &mdash; Romans 6:1-2 NET

Let us not be liars, and fake christians with false professions, by abusing the grace of our God! There is no reason to throw out morality, in fact there is every reason to believe that Christianity is a call to discipleship. This conclusion is not optional, never was, and never will be.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">If someone claims, “I know God,” but doesn’t obey God’s commandments, <span style="color:orangered;">that person is a <span style="font-size:21px;color:red;">liar</span> and is not living in the truth</span>.</span> 5 But those who **obey** God’s word truly show how completely they love him. **That is how we know** we are living in him. 6 <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.</span> &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 [NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A36%3B+1Jn+2%3A3-6&version=ESV;NET;NLT)
<!-- 6 Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? 2 Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it? -->

All theologians agree on this verse below, from the most academically sound and historically time-tested theologies known to Christendom (i.e. Reformed theology), to minority views (i.e. moderate calvinism & moderate free grace). If you are engaging in a life long continual practice of sin, an indulgent lifestyle of sin, you are severely mistaken about your walk with Christ.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Those who have been born into God’s family do not make a practice of sinning, because God’s life is in them. So they can’t keep on sinning, because they are children of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> So **now we can tell who are children of God and who are children of the devil**. Anyone who does not live righteously and does not love other believers does not belong to God. &mdash; 1 Jn 3:9-10

If this antinomian heresy is what your teachers are teaching, or what you're teaching your loved ones. YOU ARE IN GRAVE DANGER! CEASE IMMEDIATELY!

> ... They will consider nothing sacred. They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good. They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">They will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">act religious</span>, but they will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">reject the power that could make them godly</span>. Stay away from people like that!</span> &mdash; 2 Timothy 3:2-5b

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">It would be better if they had never known the way to righteousness than to know it and then reject the **command** they were given <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">to live a</span> <span style="font-size:21px;color:red;">holy life</span>.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> They prove the truth of this proverb: <span style="font-weight:bold;">“A dog returns to its vomit.”</span><span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[a]</span> And another says, “A washed pig returns to the mud.” &mdash; 2 Peter 2:21-22 NLT

All sins can be forgiven men except [blasphemy against the Holy Spirit](https://carm.org/about-the-holy-spirit/what-is-blasphemy-of-the-holy-spirit/) (Matt. 12:31-32; Mk 3:28–29; Heb. 6:4-8; 10:26-31).

> “Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin” &mdash; Mark 3:28–29 ESV

<!-- Mark 12:24 -->

<!-- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">An Admonition To False Teachers</span> -->

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” declares the Lord.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: <span style="font-weight:bold;">“You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the Lord.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the Lord. &mdash; Jeremiah 23:1-4 -->

<!-- <span style="font-size:30px;">🫶</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:25px;color:Black;">Your mistake is that you don’t know the Scriptures</span> -->

<!-- Scripture alone (*Sola Scriptura*) sure is nailed down quite nicely by Jesus words in Mark 12:24, and is somewhat eerily reminiscent of Hosea 4:6 *"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge"*. While the contexts are separate, the message is the same, scripture begets knowledge, and knowledge prevents death. -->
