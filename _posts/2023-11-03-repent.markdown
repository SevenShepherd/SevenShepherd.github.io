<!-- Faith That Does Not “Result” In The Fruit Of Repentance (A Turning From Sin) Is A Superficial & Dead Faith -->

<!-- Faith That Does Not Result In Repentance Is Not True Faith -->

<!-- Genuine Faith Results In Repentance -->

<!-- Those Who Think Repentance Is Optional Have Departed From Scripture -->

<!-- <span style="font-size:2.1em;">I. No Rational Person Could Conclude That Repentance Is Optional</span> -->

This does not conflict with *Sola Fide* or &ldquo;Faith Alone&rdquo; because repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith. Saving faith "results" in (**not** &ldquo;includes&rdquo;) obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" (**not** merits) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). **It's post-justification.** Once you're already saved, someone who was genuine about their faith would desire to repent. This article is teaching dispositions of the heart post-justification.

- 🍇 God says, *&ldquo;No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.&rdquo;* (Luke 13:3 ESV)
- 🧑 Repentance does not merit salvation, salvation produces repentance.

Repentance, obedience, and good works are all fruits of genuine saving faith. Fruits of already being saved; that's why we say they're not optional, because if the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10). I believe that no rational person could ever conclude that repentance is optional after reading the following proofs:

<a name="superficial" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">I. Is Your Faith Superficial?</a>

Here we have proof that repentance is a command from God, and additionally that disobeying this command would give strong evidence of false profession (2Pe 2:21-22). A truly saved person will desire to obey God's commandments post-justification, they will not pursue a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62)

> &ldquo;The times of **ignorance** God overlooked, but now <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">he commands</span> all people everywhere to **repent**,&rdquo; &mdash; Acts 17:30 ESV

> &ldquo;If someone claims, “I know God,” **but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">doesn’t obey God’s commandments</span>**, that person is a <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">liar</span> and is <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">not living in the truth</span>.&rdquo; &mdash; 1Jn 2:4 NLT (cf. Jn 14:15,21)

<a name="perish" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">II. Do You Want To Perish?</a>

Repent or die? Clearly those who would perish from not repenting were not genuine about their faith, because if their faith was real, they would have desired to obey Christ's command to repent (Mt 4:17; Acts 17:30). This reasoning preserves faith alone.

<!-- > No, I tell you; **but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless</span> you repent**, you will **all** likewise <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">perish</span>. &mdash; Luke 13:3 ESV -->

<a name="love" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">III. You Don't Love God?</a>

The Bible says that if you truly love God, if your faith (trust & reliance) in God is truly Genuine, that *&ldquo;you will&rdquo;* obey his commandments. It's not saying that you will be perfect, it's simply saying that the dispositon of your heart will be such that you will obey. I don't believe you can make a genuine profession of faith, and not repent, because that would mean you hate God, and no true Christian hates God.

<!-- > “If you love me, <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will</span> keep my commandments.&rdquo; &mdash; John 14:15 ESV -->

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">“If you love me,</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will obey my commandments</span>. &mdash; John 14:15 NET

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me**. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.” &mdash; John 14:21 NET

<a name="forgiven" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">IV. You Don't Want Your Sins Forgiven?</a>

The gospel can be summarized in different ways. Sometimes faith alone is named as the one thing necessary for salvation (see John 3:16; Acts 10:43; 13:38-39; 16:31; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 2:8–9), other times repentance alone is named (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10), and sometimes both are named (Acts 20:21). Genuine faith always involves repentance, and vice versa. But the preaching of repentance to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:46-47).

> ... ‘There is **forgiveness of sins** for all who **repent**.’ &mdash; Luke 24:47 NLT

> **Repent** therefore, and turn back, that **your sins may be blotted out**, &mdash; Acts 3:19 ESV

> Peter replied, “Each of you <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">must</span> **repent** of your sins and turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ **for the forgiveness of your sins**. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. &mdash; Acts 2:38 NLT

> God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give **repentance** to Israel and **forgiveness of sins**. &mdash; Acts 5:31 ESV

Because belief (Acts 10:43) & repentance (Ac 3:19) are repeatedly said to result in the forgiveness of sins, we say that saving faith results in repentance necessarily. Faith (trust & reliance) is intertwined with a resulting repentance (a turn from sin), because a genuine non-superficial faith carries with it a heart change. This could very will be God's work in us through the concept of regeneration (John 3:7).

<!-- It's true that we are saved by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-10), but it's also true that saving faith results in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that follow after justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). Repentance is an immediate fruit (obedience) of genuine saving faith resulting in good works and righteous behavior (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5). That is why faith and repentance are so near one another in scripture, because one flows naturally from the other.

> ... ‘There is **forgiveness of sins** for all who **repent**.’ &mdash; Luke 24:47 NLT

> **Repent** therefore, and turn back, that **your sins may be blotted out**, &mdash; Acts 3:19 ESV

> Peter replied, “Each of you <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">must</span> **repent** of your sins and turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ **for the forgiveness of your sins**. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. &mdash; Acts 2:38 NLT

> God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give **repentance** to Israel and **forgiveness of sins**. &mdash; Acts 5:31 ESV

You can cite verses like Acts 10:43; 13:38-39 to show that *&ldquo;...everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins...&rdquo;*, but this further bolsters my position, that faith (trust & reliance) is intertwined with a resulting repentance (a turn from sin), because a genuine non-superficial faith carries with it a heart change. 

> It is true that faith is the means by which people receive salvation (Rom 3:22-25; Eph 2:8), but **faith that does not involve repentance is not true faith**. It is [not a faith that leads to salvation](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#living). ... &mdash; [**AMG Concise Bible Dictionary**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/#amg-concise) -->

<a name="led" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">V. You Don’t Want To Be Led To Salvation?</a>

Godly grief leading to radically different dispositions of the heart is granted and leads to salvation and eternal life. This could be interpreted as part of predestination or providence, but Acts 17:30 also says it's a command. In any case, disobeying God gives strong evidence of a false profession (1Jn 2:4). Who wouldn't want to be lead to salvation and eternal life?

> For <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">godly grief produces</span> a repentance that <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">leads to</span> salvation</span> without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. &mdash; 2 Corinthians 7:10 ESV

<!-- > When the others heard this, they stopped objecting and began praising God. They said, “We can see that God has also given the Gentiles the privilege of repenting of their sins and receiving eternal life.” &mdash; Acts 11:18 NLT -->

> When they heard this, they ceased their objections and praised God, saying, “So then, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">God has <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">granted</span> the repentance that <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">leads to</span> life</span> even to the Gentiles.” &mdash; Acts 11:18 NET

<a name="hell" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">VI. Dangers Of Departing From Scripture</a>

When the rich man had died and gone to hell, in torment he begged to warn his brothers, who were still alive, by implying that repentance would save them from hell. *&ldquo;Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ.&rdquo;*

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">repent</span>.’ <sup style="font-weight:bold;">31</sup> He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’” &mdash; Luke 16:30-31 ESV

The implications here are powerful. Your faith should not be superficial and dead (James 2:14-26) if your heart has genuinely changed through genuine faith (trust & reliance) in God. If you're not seeing dispositions of the heart towards contrition and a turning away from sin, are you really being sanctified, and if you're not being sanctified can you really say you're justified.

> **Remember** therefore from where you have fallen; <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">repent</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">remove your lampstand</span> from its place, <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless you repent</span>.</span> &mdash; Revelation 2:5 ESV

> Therefore <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">repent</span>. <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">If not, I will come to you soon and war</span> against them with the sword of my mouth. &mdash; Revelation 2:16 ESV

> Therefore, remember what you received and heard, and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">obey it, and repent</span>. <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">If you do not wake up</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">I will come like a thief, and you will never know at what hour I will come against you.</span> &mdash; Revelation 3:3 NET

> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">They were scorched by the fierce heat</span>, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">They did not repent</span> and give him glory. &mdash; Revelation 16:9 NET

Saving faith **does not include** obedience, saving faith **results in** obedience. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts but instead a trust and reliance in Christ. Genuine saving faith will always be accompanied by good works that come **after justification**. Good works and continuing to believe **follow** saving faith (*sola fide*).

<!-- is the result of an underwhelming life lived in opposition to God's commands (Jn 14:15,21; 1Jn 2:4). -->

<a name="result" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">VII. Genuine Faith Repents</a>

God has granted the repentance (Ac 11:18; 2 Tim. 2:25), and commanded us to repent (Ac 17:30; Mt 4:17; Lk 13:3). **Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith**, and is defined as a turning away from sin to God (Acts 26:20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), for the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31). It is His kindness (Ro 2:4) that leads us to this godly sorrow and contrition which produces a repentance that leads to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18). Unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (Luke 17:3-4 NLT; 1Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).

> No, I tell you; but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless you repent</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will</span> all likewise <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">perish</span>. &mdash; Luke 13:3 ESV

As [the most authoritative Greek lexicon](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) reveals, every instance of [metanoéō](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [metánoia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) means *“feel remorse, repent, be converted” (in religio-ethical sense)*. We can thereby conclude that the meaning does not reflect it's etymology and is not just a change of mind, but instead it is a turning from sin to God in trust.

> Then he said, “I tell you the truth, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless you turn</span> from your sins and become like little children, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven</span>. &mdash; Matthew 18:3 NLT

We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only are you showing evidence that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but you're also showing evidence that your profession of faith is false (1Jn 2:3-6). Make sure your heart has not betrayed you (Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9), examine your faith to see if it is genuine (2Cor. 13:5 NLT).

<!-- Remember this, I am not your enemy. If I were your enemy, I would not be attempting to show you the truth. I'm not asking you to be perfect, I'm asking you to be genuine. -->

> The gospel can be summarized in different ways. Sometimes faith alone is named as the one thing necessary for salvation (see John 3:16; Acts 16:31; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 2:8–9), other times repentance alone is named (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10), and sometimes both are named (Acts 20:21). **Genuine faith always involves repentance, and vice versa**.

There is only one unforgivable sin, make sure you don't die in that state. Perhaps I should say, that God will make sure you won't die in that state if you're foreknown. Repentance and faith are granted afterall (Jn 6:29; Phil. 1:29; Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25). In fact this whole article could be rephrased to account for predestination. Perhaps it's God's work in you? Where is his signature in your life? Either way, it's never our works that save us (Eph 2:8-10). Repentance is simply an outflowing from genuine saving faith.

<!-- That Is dying in an unrepentant state of disbelief, or even a superficial state of assent, instead of a repentant and genuine state of personal trust and reliance on God's grace through faith only. This will always result in a contrite heart. -->

> Christians who fear that they may have committed the unpardonable sin show by their very anxiety that they have not done so. Persons who have committed it are unremorseful and unconcerned; indeed, they are ordinarily unaware of what they have done and to what fate they have sentenced themselves. &mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford). 88. UNPARDONABLE SIN - **Only Impenitence Cannot Be Forgiven**. On [faith](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo), on [repentance](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8).

When you falsely teach anti-Christ doctrines of optional repentance, you teach child molesters to keep molesting, murderers to keep murdering, rapists to keep raping, occultists to keep sacrificing to demons, and idolaters to keep their idolatries. You fill the church with monsters and hypocrites who prey on little children and you understand nothing of faith alone, scripture, or Christ.

Genuine faith results in repentance. Departing from scripture by saying that it's optional is extraordinarily bad theology. Repentance will happen if your profession of faith is genuine. Don't depart from scripture.
