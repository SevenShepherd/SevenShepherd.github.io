<!-- Those Who Think Repentance Is Optional Have Departed From Scripture -->

<!-- <span style="font-size:2.1em;">I. No Rational Person Could Conclude That Repentance Is Optional</span> -->

This does not conflict with *Sola Fide* or &ldquo;Faith Alone&rdquo; because repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith. Saving faith "results" in (**not** &ldquo;includes&rdquo;) obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" (**not** merits) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). **It's post-justification.** I believe that no rational person could ever conclude that repentance is optional because of the following proofs:

<span style="font-size:2.1em;">I. Is Your Faith Superficial?</span>

It would seem that the only people who don't want to repent, are those who've made a false professions (2Pe 2:21-22), who want to defend a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).

> &ldquo;The times of **ignorance** God overlooked, but now <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">he commands</span> all people everywhere to **repent**,&rdquo; &mdash; Acts 17:30 ESV

> &ldquo;If someone claims, ‚ÄúI know God,‚Äù **but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">doesn‚Äôt obey God‚Äôs commandments</span>**, that person is a <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">liar</span> and is <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">not living in the truth</span>.&rdquo; &mdash; 1Jn 2:4 NLT

<span style="font-size:2.1em;">II. Do You Want To Perish?</span>

Repent or die? Maybe thats the option you're talking about? Doesn't sound like a good disposition of the heart.

> No, I tell you; **but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless</span> you repent**, you will **all** likewise <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">perish</span>. &mdash; Luke 13:3 ESV

<span style="font-size:2.1em;">III. You Don't Love God?</span>

I don't believe you can make a genuine profession of faith, and hate God at the same time, that would be absurd.

> ‚ÄúIf you love me, **you will** keep my commandments.&rdquo; &mdash; John 14:15 ESV

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me**. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.‚Äù &mdash; John 14:21 NET

<span style="font-size:2.1em;">IV. Conclusion</span>

As [every authoritative Greek lexicon](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) reveals, every instance of [metano√©≈ç](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [met√°noia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) means *‚Äúfeel remorse, repent, be converted‚Äù (in religio-ethical sense)*, it is a contrition (2Cor. 7:10) that leads to a turning away from sin to God (Acts 26:20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), for the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31), leading to salvation (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).

We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only are you showing evidence that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but you're also showing evidence that your profession of faith is false (1Jn 2:3-6). Make sure your heart has not betrayed you (Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9), examine your faith to see if it is genuine (2Cor. 13:5 NLT).

<!-- Remember this, I am not your enemy. If I were your enemy, I would not be attempting to show you the truth. I'm not asking you to be perfect, I'm asking you to be genuine. -->

> The gospel can be summarized in different ways. Sometimes faith alone is named as the one thing necessary for salvation (see John 3:16; Acts 16:31; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 2:8‚Äì9), other times repentance alone is named (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10), and sometimes both are named (Acts 20:21). **Genuine faith always involves repentance, and vice versa**.

<!-- # Repentance
- Repentance is **a turning away from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is **a Godly sorrow** that **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance is necessary (Lk 13:3) **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5) -->

<!-- - As [every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/), **the meaning does not reflect it's etymology**: all instances of the Greek words for repentance fall under the second meaning of ‚Äúfeel remorse, repent, be converted‚Äù (in religio-ethical sense). -->

I am shocked that I have to write an elementary article like this. When you hate people who have never personally attacked you and then you escalate it further by slandering them or otherwise, you're acting on behalf of Satan. -->
