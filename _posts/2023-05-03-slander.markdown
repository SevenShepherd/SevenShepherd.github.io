<!-- <span style="font-size:2.1em;">A Message To Slanderers In The Church</span> -->

**To all who falsely claim to be "Christian," but slander and hate other believers.** You should know that the Bible calls you a godless [liar](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/god-is-love/) (1 John 4:8, 20; 2:3-6, 9-11; Pr 11:9) and a child of Satan (1 Jn 3:10). Repent and turn (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:2,8) from your wickedness and false professions (2Pe 2:21-22).

<!-- Stay away from believers demon, unless you repent and turn (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:2,8) from your wickedness and false professions (2Pe 2:21-22). -->

<!-- To all of you who make a mockery of fellowship and attack the innocent who are struggling to do what is right. -->

<!-- That is who your father truly is, the father of lies, false witness, fakes, and slanderers. Stay away from believers demon, unless you repent and turn (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:2,8) from your wickedness and false professions (2Pe 2:21-22). -->

<!-- > "With their words, the godless destroy their friends, but knowledge will rescue the righteous." &mdash; Proverbs 11:9 -->

<!-- If a Christian's life is devoid of the fruit of the Holy spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21), they have likely deceived themselves (James 1:22) into believing that they have genuine faith (2Cor. 13:5).  -->

<!-- Don't you know that the Bible describes those who constantly find fault with others and speak maliciously about them (Ro 1:30) as deserving death (Ro 1:32)? The Bible gives a clear warning to those who practice strife, rivalries, dissensions, and divisions that they will not inherit The Kingdom of God (Gal. 5:19-21). That those who abuse the Grace of our God are those marked out for condemnation long ago (Jd 4 NET). -->

> There are six things which Yahweh hates, Even seven **which are an abomination to Him**: Haughty eyes, **a lying tongue**, And hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked thoughts, Feet that hasten to run to evil, **A false witness who breathes out lies, And one who spreads strife among brothers.** &mdash; Proverbs 6:16-19

<!-- If you do not cease your assault on true believers (Heb. 10:26-31; Ro 6:1-2; 1Jn 3:9-10), your eternal destiny is the lake which burns with fire and brimstone (Re 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32; 1Co 6:9-10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph 5:3-5; Mt 7:21,23). Where the worm dies not and the fire is not quenched (Mk 9:48), and the smoke of your torment ascends up for ever and ever (Rv. 14:11 KJV). -->

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> ‚ÄúWoe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!‚Äù declares the Lord. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: ‚ÄúYou have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the Lord. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the Lord. -->

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> **Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!** saith the Lord. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, **I will visit upon you the evil of your doings**, saith the Lord &mdash; Jeremiah 23:1-2 -->

<!-- Without a caring shepherd, the sheep are scattered and left vulnerable to predators. Pastors, why do you allow this injustice in the house of God? Remove the evil within your church or God will vist upon you the evil of your doings. It is in fact your job to remove the evil person (1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT) even if they are leading your ministry in worship. -->

<!-- Antinomian hypocrite, don't you understand that abusing God's grace is heresy (Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2; Heb 6:4-6; 10:26-31; 1Jn 2:3-6, 3:9-10)? Ignorant one, have you not considered that if a Christian's life is devoid of the fruit of the Holy spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21) that you will not inherit the kingdom of God? -->

> ‚Äú... When God became a man Himself, the experience proved to be nothing short of pure agony. In man‚Äôs time-honored fashion, they would unleash the whole arsenal of weapons against Him: **misrepresentation, slander, and accusation of treason**. The stage was set for a situation without parallel in the history of the earth. God would visit creatures and they would nail Him to the cross!‚Äù &mdash; Werner von Braun, the father of space science
