<!-- <span style="font-size:2.1em;">Slander Is A Good Sign You Are Fake</span> -->

Just a reminder to those of you call yourself a Christian, but slander and hate other believers, that the bible calls you a [liar](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/god-is-love/) (1 John 4:8,20; 2:9-11). If a Christian's life is devoid of the fruit of the Holy spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21), they have likely deceived themselves (James 1:22) into believing that they have genuine faith (2Cor. 13:5). 

<!-- > "With their words, the godless destroy their friends, but knowledge will rescue the righteous." &mdash; Proverbs 11:9 -->

> There are six things which Yahweh hates, Even seven **which are an abomination to Him**: Haughty eyes, **a lying tongue**, And hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked thoughts, Feet that hasten to run to evil, **A false witness who breathes out lies, And one who spreads strife among brothers.** &mdash; Proverbs 6:16-19

No one born of God makes a practice of sinning (1Jn 3:9). If you are living a lifestyle of indulgent sin against other Christians, the Bible calls you a child of the satan (1 Jn 3:10). That is who your father truly is, the father of lies, false witness, fakes, and slander. Stay away from believers demon, unless you repent and turn (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:2,8) from your wickedness and fake professions (2Pe 2:21-22).

In man’s time-honored fashion, they would unleash the whole arsenal of weapons against Him: **misrepresentation, slander, and accusation of treason**. The stage was set for a situation without parallel in the history of the earth. God would visit creatures and they would nail Him to the cross!” &mdash; Werner von Braun, the father of space science
