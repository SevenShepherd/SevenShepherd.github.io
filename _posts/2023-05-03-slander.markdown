<!-- The Bible Is Clear, If You Hate And Slander Other Believers, You Do Not Belong To God. -->

<!-- If You Say That You Are Christian But You Hate And Slander Other Believers You're By Definition Fake -->

<!-- ‚ö° -->

<!-- ‚ÄúWith their words, the godless destroy their friends, but knowledge will rescue the righteous.‚Äù ‚Äî Proverbs 11:9" -->

<span style="font-size:2.1em;">An Admonition To Slanderers In The Church</span>

> It isn‚Äôt my responsibility to judge outsiders, but **it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning**. God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, **‚ÄúYou must remove the evil person from among you.‚Äù** 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT

**All those who claim to be "Christian," but hate and slander other believers;** the Bible rightly calls <a href="#lying">godless<sup>1</sup></a>, <a href="#lying">liars<sup>1</sup></a>, and <a href="#doomed">children of the devil<sup>5</sup></a>. The Holy Bible specifically states that we can tell who belongs to God and who belongs to the devil, by simply observing their behavior toward other Christians overtime.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> So now <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">we can tell</span> who are children of God and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">who are children of the devil</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-size:1.4em;">Anyone</span> who does not live righteously<span style="font-weight:normal;color:#A8A8A8;">[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%203%3A10&version=MOUNCE">dikaiosynƒì</a>]</span> and does not love<span style="font-weight:normal;color:#A8A8A8;">[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%203%3A10&version=MOUNCE">agapa≈ç</a>]</span> other believers does not belong to God</span>. &mdash; 1 John 3:10

The Bible gives a clear warning to all those who practice strife, rivalries, dissensions, and divisions, that they will not <a href="#fruit">inherit the Kingdom of God<sup>3</sup></a>. If a Christian's life is devoid of the <a href="#fruit">fruit of the Holy spirit<sup>3</sup></a>, and they are practicing the works of the flesh continually, they have very likely <a href="#genuine">deceived themselves<sup>4</sup></a> into believing that they have Genuine faith.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> ... Let me tell you again, as I have before, that <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-size:1.4em;">anyone</span> living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.</span> &mdash; Gal. 5:19-21b

<!-- If you do not cease your relentless assault on true believers<sup><a href="#doomed">5</a></sup>, your -->

The eternal destiny of all those who do not inherit the Kingdom of God is devastating. Do not be <a href="#genuine">self-deceived<sup>4</sup></a>, use scripture to recognize if you have <a href="#genuine">failed the test of Genuine faith.<sup>4</sup></a> There is a lake which burns with fire and brimstone<sup><a href="#brimstone">6</a></sup>; where the worm dies not and the fire is not quenched<sup><a href="#hell">7</a></sup>, and the smoke of the torment of those who end up their will ascend up for ever and ever<sup><a href="#hell">7</a></sup>. Be sure that this isn't you.

> ... <span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[The Gospel Message]</span> does not allow for someone to obtain salvation simply by intellectually believing that Jesus is the Son of God without repenting of sins and turning to live for him. &mdash; [Mounce‚Äôs Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/#mounced)

As [every authoritative Greek lexicon](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/) reveals, repentance means *‚Äúfeel remorse, repent, be converted‚Äù (in religio-ethical sense)*, it is a contrition that leads to a turning away from sin (repentance), and a turning to God (faith); repentance is not an attrition that only produces a worldly sorrow and an intellectual assent to facts (James 2:19).

> For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. &mdash; 2 Corinthians 7:10 ( cf. 8‚Äì13)

If this article describes you, please <a href="#turn">repent and turn away<sup>2</sup></a> from this wickedness and recognize the there is a strong possibility that you've made a false profession (2Pe 2:21-22). All sins can be forgiven men except [blasphemy against the Holy Spirit](https://carm.org/about-the-holy-spirit/what-is-blasphemy-of-the-holy-spirit/) (Matt. 12:31-32; Mk 3:28‚Äì29; Heb. 6:4-8; 10:26-31).

<!-- > ‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin‚Äù &mdash; Mark 3:28‚Äì29 ESV -->

> Christians who fear that they may have committed the unpardonable sin show by their very anxiety that they have not done so. Persons who have committed it are unremorseful and unconcerned; indeed, they are ordinarily unaware of what they have done and to what fate they have sentenced themselves. &mdash; <a href="#packer">Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford). 88. UNPARDONABLE SIN - **Only Impenitence Cannot Be Forgiven**</a>

Make sure your spirit is of God (Phil. 2:3; 1Thess. 5:11). Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand (Matt. 3:2, 4:17; Mk 1:15; Lk 15:7). Pastors, you need to place safeguards in your churches to protect the true believers in your congregation who are under assault by the enemy.


<!-- Stay away from believers demon, unless you repent and turn (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:2,8) from your wickedness and false professions (2Pe 2:21-22). -->

<!-- To all of you who make a mockery of fellowship and attack the innocent who are struggling to do what is right. -->

<!-- That is who your father truly is, the father of lies, false witness, fakes, and slanderers. Stay away from believers demon, unless you repent and turn (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:2,8) from your wickedness and false professions (2Pe 2:21-22). -->

<!-- > "With their words, the godless destroy their friends, but knowledge will rescue the righteous." &mdash; Proverbs 11:9 -->

<!-- If a Christian's life is devoid of the fruit of the Holy spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21), they have likely deceived themselves (James 1:22) into believing that they have genuine faith (2Cor. 13:5).  -->

<!-- Don't you know that the Bible describes those who constantly find fault with others and speak maliciously about them (Ro 1:30) as deserving death (Ro 1:32)? The Bible gives a clear warning to those who practice strife, rivalries, dissensions, and divisions that they will not inherit The Kingdom of God (Gal. 5:19-21). That those who abuse the Grace of our God are those marked out for condemnation long ago (Jd 4 NET). -->

<!-- If you do not cease your assault on true believers (Heb. 10:26-31; Ro 6:1-2; 1Jn 3:9-10), your eternal destiny is the lake which burns with fire and brimstone (Re 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32; 1Co 6:9-10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph 5:3-5; Mt 7:21,23). Where the worm dies not and the fire is not quenched (Mk 9:48), and the smoke of your torment ascends up for ever and ever (Rv. 14:11 KJV). -->

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> ‚ÄúWoe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!‚Äù declares the Lord. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: ‚ÄúYou have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the Lord. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the Lord. -->

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> **Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!** saith the Lord. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, **I will visit upon you the evil of your doings**, saith the Lord &mdash; Jeremiah 23:1-2 -->

<!-- Without a caring shepherd, the sheep are scattered and left vulnerable to predators. Pastors, why do you allow this injustice in the house of God? Remove the evil within your church or God will vist upon you the evil of your doings. It is in fact your job to remove the evil person (1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT) even if they are leading your ministry in worship. -->

<!-- Antinomian hypocrite, don't you understand that abusing God's grace is heresy (Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2; Heb 6:4-6; 10:26-31; 1Jn 2:3-6, 3:9-10)? Ignorant one, have you not considered that if a Christian's life is devoid of the fruit of the Holy spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21) that you will not inherit the kingdom of God? -->
