<a name="moderate_arminianism" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">I. Moderate Arminianism</a>

Reformed Wesleyanism, Reformed Arminianism, Calvinistic Arminianism, or Moderate Arminianism is a modified form of Arminianism, much like Amyraldism is a modified form of Calvinism.

> Moderate Calvinists and moderate Arminians, who represent the vast majority of Christendom, have much in common against the extremes in the opposing two views. Indeed, John Wesley himself (a moderate Arminian) said he was only a “hair’s breadth from Calvin.” And as is later demonstrated in appendix 2, Calvin himself rejected some things held in later extreme Calvinism (e.g., limited atonement). &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler (Ph.D., Philosophy, Pennsylvania; M.A., Theology, Wheaton), Moderate Calvinist ([Amyraldian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/)).

<a name="distinctives" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">II. Distinctives of Moderate Arminianism</a>

- Total Depravity (Reformed)
- Conditional Election (Wesleyan / Armin.)
- Unlimited Atonement (Moderately Reformed or Arm.)
- Resistible Grace (Arminian)
- Perseverance of The Saints (Modified)
    - Progressive Sanctification (Reformed)

> Reformed Arminians reject the idea, found in traditional Wesleyanism, that falling into sin will cause one to fall from grace until repentance restores the sinner back to a state of grace. In other words, according to Reformed Arminianism, a believer cannot fall out of salvation, but he can willingly forfeit it, and once he apostatizes, he is **lost forever**. &mdash; [GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/Reformed-Arminianism.html)


<a name="OrdoSalutis" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">III. Ordo Salutis</a>

> Evangelicals in the broadly Reformed tradition insist that the whole of salvation, from eternity past to eternity future, proceeds from the grace of God, centers on Christ, and is wrought by the power of the Holy Spirit. &mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest

<!-- - Without regard for foreseen human faith or good works, God in eternity past chose from among the lot of fallen humanity some to inherit eternal life. -->


1. **Election**
    - With regard for foreseen human faith, God in eternity past chose those whom he foresaw would have faith in him to inherit eternal life. This is known as the Wesleyan Foreknowledge view of election.
2. **Effectual calling**
    - The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.
    - The general call to trust Christ is issued through the widespread offer of the Gospel. By means of this general call God sovereignly issues a special calling to the elect. The Spirit facilitates sinners’ response to the Gospel by enlightening their minds, liberating their wills, and inclining their affections Godward.
2. **Regeneration**
    - Without any human assistance the third person of the Trinity creates new spiritual life, including God-honoring dispositions, affections, and habits.
3. **Faith**
    - Having been granted new spiritual life, the elect believe the truths of the Gospel and trust Jesus Christ as Savior. Faith is viewed as a gift and enablement of God, indeed as a consequence of new spiritual birth.
4. **Repentance**
    - Here believers grieve for sins committed and deliberately turn from all known disobedience. This response likewise is a divine enablement.
5. **Justification**
    - On the basis of Christ’s completed work, the Father reckons to believers the righteousness of his Son, remits sins, and admits the same to the divine favor. Justification is the legal declaration of believing sinners’ right standing with God.
6. **Sanctification**
    - The Holy Spirit works in justified believers the will and the power progressively to renounce sin and to advance in spiritual maturity and Christlikeness. By the process of sanctification God makes believers experientially holy.
7. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - &ldquo;Reformed Arminianism also holds to the perseverance of the saints through faith alone—another tenet of Calvinism—with a caveat. Reformed Arminians believe that Christians can lose their salvation, but only by renouncing their faith. Reformed Arminians reject the idea, found in traditional Wesleyanism, that falling into sin will cause one to fall from grace until repentance restores the sinner back to a state of grace. In other words, according to Reformed Arminianism, a believer cannot fall out of salvation, but he can willingly forfeit it, and once he apostatizes, he is **lost forever**.&rdquo; &mdash; [GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/Reformed-Arminianism.html)
8. **Glorification**
    - God will complete the redemption of the saints when the latter behold Christ at his second advent and are transformed into his likeness.
