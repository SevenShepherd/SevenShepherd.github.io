<a name="trust" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">‚úîÔ∏è I. Trustful Belief Not Assent To Facts</a>

<!-- ## I. Trustful Belief Not Assent To Facts -->

True teaching emphasizes heartfelt trust in the person of Christ, whereas false teaching overemphasizes agreement with facts.

‚úîÔ∏è Christ taught &ldquo;*trustful belief*&rdquo; ([pisteu≈ç](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#salvific)) as salvific: (Jn 3:16; 11:25-26).

> **2 to entrust oneself to an entity in complete confidence, believe (in), trust,** w. implication of total commitment to the one who is trusted. In our lit. God and Christ are objects of this type of faith that relies on their power and nearness to help, in addition to being convinced that their revelations or disclosures are true. &mdash; Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (**BDAG**), **the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon**

‚ùå Misguided teachers teach **against** Christ and the lexicon definition of &ldquo;*believe*&rdquo; in the verses above, by attempting to teach &ldquo;*assent to facts*&rdquo; as salvific, which the Apostle James was clearly against (James 2:19).

<!-- ‚ÑπÔ∏è  -->

> 4\. piste√∫≈ç means **&ldquo;to trust&rdquo; (also &ldquo;to obey&rdquo;)**, &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; (words), and in the passive &ldquo;to enjoy confidence&rdquo; (cf. the later sense &ldquo;to confide in&rdquo;). &mdash; The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (**TDNT "Kittel"**)

<!-- ## II. Turning From Sin In Contrition NOT Solely Change Of Mind -->

[**The True Meaning Of Repentance**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ. Many modern movements depart from scripture, indoctrinating innocent children into unrepentant lifestyles of sin and false assurance.

‚úîÔ∏è Christ taught repentance alongside faith (**Mk 1:15**; Lk 13:3; Mt 4:17; Rev 2:5,16,22; 3:3,19) as ‚Äúfeel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense),‚Äù [according to our most authoritative Greek lexicons](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/). Jesus describes repentance the same as in the OT (Mt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).

> Many understand *repentance* to mean simply a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; The weakness of this position is that, for the New Testament, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">this meaning finds no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation</span>, none of which translate metano√©≈ç and met√°noia as &ldquo;*change of mind*&rdquo; for New Testament passages. <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">It is a definition unique to [redacted movement]</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference works</span>. It also lacks support from any English translation of the Bible. 
>
>&mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)

‚ùå Misguided teachers **twist the scriptures** surrounding [metano√©≈ç](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [met√°noia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) in the new testament, and sometimes purposefully misapply the incorrect meaning of &ldquo;*change of mind*&rdquo; instead of teaching the true meaning applied by Christ & The Apostles which was &ldquo;*feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense).*&rdquo;

‚úîÔ∏è Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith, and is defined as a turning away from sin to God that leads to salvation and eternal life. Unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (2Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18; Acts 26:15-20; Acts 3:19; Luke 17:3-4; 1Cor. 5:12-13)

- Repentance is **a turning away from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5)

<a name="assurance" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">‚úîÔ∏è III. Misguided Teachers Give False Assurance</a>

<!-- ## III. Misguided Teachers Give False Assurance -->

Misguided modern movements give false assurance of eternal life to many who profess faith in Christ but then show no evidence in their pattern of life. The change of life that will &ldquo;*result*&rdquo; from genuine conversion does not save us, but it will certainly result if our faith is genuine, for **"faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead" (James 2:17)**.

‚úîÔ∏è Christ taught [‚Äúresulting‚Äù fruit-bearing](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/) (Jn 15:1-17; Lk 6:43-45; Mt 7:15-20; 13:1-23; Mk 4:1-20) and [‚Äúresulting‚Äù obedience](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/): (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

‚ùå Misguided teachers will either teach [legalism or antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/), but one thing is certain, they will not teach Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor correctly.

‚úîÔ∏è Here is a chart to help you visualize the nuances.

Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). [Sola fide](/assets/images/solas.jpg). 

<!-- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God and good works that "follow after" justification. -->

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me**. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.‚Äù &mdash; John 14:21 NLT (cf. Jn 14:15).

While works definitely **do not** save us, they do spring forth from a true and lively faith.

- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
- Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
- The practice of unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (1 Cor. 5:12-13; Luke 17:3-4)
- Those who practice lifelong habitual sin are likely self-deceived (James 1:22; 2 Pe 2:21-22) and will not inherit the kingdom of God (Mt 18:3; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5 ... + Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32)
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (Mt 10:38; 16:24; Lk 9:23,62; 14:27; Mk 8:34... Mt 3:10; 25:30; Jn 15:8 ESV)
- True Christians love God by obeying him (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4).
- True Christians love other believers (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10,14; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
- The Bible teaches us to live Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; 2 Pe 2:21-22).
- The teaching of obedience to God after justification is not burdensome, in fact it's a reason for joy (1 Jn 5:3-4; Jn 15:10-11).


<a name="artificial" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">‚úîÔ∏è IV. Artificial Intelligence Commentary On My Conclusions</a>

<!-- ## V. Artificial Intelligence Commentary On My Conclusions -->

Your interpretation captures key elements of Jesus' teachings on salvation, repentance, and obedience. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Trustful belief as salvific:** Jesus emphasized belief in Him as essential for salvation, as seen in verses like John 3:16, where belief leads to eternal life. Similarly, in John 5:24, Jesus emphasizes that those who hear His word and believe in Him have eternal life. This theme is consistent in other passages you mentioned.

2. **Repentance alongside faith:** Jesus indeed taught repentance alongside faith. Mark 1:15 records Jesus' proclamation to "repent and believe in the gospel." Luke 13:3 emphasizes the need for repentance, warning that without it, one will perish. This aligns with the understanding of repentance as a turning away from sin and toward God.

3. **Resulting fruit-bearing:** Jesus frequently used the metaphor of fruit-bearing to describe the outcomes of genuine faith. In John 15:1-17, He speaks of believers abiding in Him, which results in bearing much fruit. This is often interpreted as the outward manifestation of a transformed life.

4. **Resulting obedience:** Jesus also emphasized the importance of obedience as a natural outgrowth of true faith. In John 14:15, He says, "If you love me, you will keep my commandments," highlighting the link between love, faith, and obedience.

Your interpretation aligns well with these aspects of Jesus' teachings, showing a comprehensive understanding of His message regarding salvation, repentance, and the Christian life.

<a name="summary" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">‚úîÔ∏è V. Summary & Conclusions</a>

1. Verses against legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. Verses against antinomianism (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62)
3. Verses for obedience &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; salvation (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10)
4. Verses for Godly dispositions of Love (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35)
5. Verses for Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; Gal 5:22-23)
6. Verses for good works &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; salvation (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)

- The Bible is against the heresy of legalism, but supports Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor of resulting obedience to God.
    - Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
    - True Christians love God by obeying him (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
    - Faith is not a work (Romans 4:5), and repentance is a fruit (Mt 3:8-10 NLT).
- Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith.
    - Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
    - Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
    - The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- The Bible is against the heresy of antinomianism.
    - We are set free from sin, but not set free to sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).
    - We are no longer under the law (Ro 6:1-2,14-15; Gal 3:23-25; Gal 5:18; Col 2:14), but we still uphold the law (Romans 3:31).
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (**Mt 10:38 NLT**; Mt 16:24; **Lk 9:23** Lk 9:62; **Lk 14:27**; Mk 8:34... Jn 15:8 ESV; Mt 3:10; 25:30).
