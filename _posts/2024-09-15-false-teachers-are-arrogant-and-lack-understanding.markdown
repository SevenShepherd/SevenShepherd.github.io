False teachers that teach something different than Christ's repentance as [a turning away from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repent-means-turn/) to God (Acts 3:26,19), are **arrogant, conceited, and lack understanding.** Repentance as a turning from sin was taught alongside faith as a *&ldquo;trustful belief&rdquo;* by Christ Himself (Mark 1:14-15).

<!-- the Apostle Paul revealed that repentance is produced from godly sorrow (2Cor 7:10), and Jude reveals that we should hate sin but remain merciful to the sinner (Jude 23). -->

When false teachers teach such falsehoods they either purposefully, or inadvertently lead their congregations into destruction. Once you identify these wolves, flee from them.

> The term [metanoéō (μετανοέω)](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) means *“feel remorse, repent, be converted in a (religio-)ethical sense,”* while [metánoia (μετάνοια)](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) means *“repentance, turning about, conversion”* (Danker et al. 567–568). These definitions are drawn from [the world's most authoritative Greek lexicon available](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/#BDAG).
