False teachers that teach something different than Christ's repentance as [a turning away from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repent-means-turn/) to God (Acts 3:26,19), are **arrogant, conceited, and lack understanding.** Repentance, understood as a turning away from sin, was taught alongside faith, which Christ defined as a *&ldquo;trustful belief&rdquo;* (Mark 1:14-15)

<!-- Repentance as a turning from sin was taught alongside faith which inturn was taught as a *&ldquo;trustful belief&rdquo;* by Christ Himself (Mark 1:14-15). -->


<!-- the Apostle Paul revealed that repentance is produced from godly sorrow (2Cor 7:10), and Jude reveals that we should hate sin but remain merciful to the sinner (Jude 23). -->

When false teachers teach falsehoods, like deceptive assent only versions of the Gospel, they either purposefully, or inadvertently lead their congregations into destruction. Once you identify these wolves, flee from them. **Repentance and faith go hand in hand.**

> The gospel can be summarized in different ways. Sometimes faith alone is named as the one thing necessary for salvation (see John 3:16; Acts 16:31; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 2:8–9), other times repentance alone is named (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10), and sometimes both are named (Acts 20:21). **Genuine faith always involves repentance, and vice versa**.

> Because faith involves repentance and repentance involves faith, the Bible in some places speaks of forgiveness as depending on faith (Acts 10:43; 13:38-39), in others as depending on repentance (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26).

> The term [metanoéō (μετανοέω)](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) means *“feel remorse, repent, be converted in a (religio-)ethical sense,”* while [metánoia (μετάνοια)](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) means *“repentance, turning about, conversion”* (Bauer et al. 567–568). These definitions are drawn from [the world's most authoritative Greek lexicon available](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/#BDAG).
