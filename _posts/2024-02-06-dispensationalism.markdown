Growing up, dispensationalism was probably one of my favorite eschatological systems. It brought me such hope and joy to look forward to a pre-tribulational rapture, but over the years, and the more I study it, the more pronounced it's flaws seem to be. I'm presenting this small critique because i'm about to study eschatological from 6 different systems simultaneously. If I absolutely had to change systems, I'd probably look into Historic Premillennialism, a system held by [Dr. Walter Martin](https://youtu.be/uO0TAHKzPFw?si=qbF7x_gk18zTGVht), and D. A. Carson.

# 🔥 Dispensational Theology Was Developed From The Vision Of A 15 Year Old Girl In The 1800s. Now That's Strange Fire.

The first 1:20 seconds of this video will floor you if you understand the gravity of what is being said.

> so what I elected to do this evening is something very simple how many have your Bibles good what I'd like to do is to tell you first off that the position I am going to set forth tonight is not new as number one secondly the position I will set forth tonight was believed by the Christian Church for 19 centuries the Church Fathers the Reformers every great theologian in the entire history of the church up until the last 140 years believed that we would see the Anti Christ that we would be persecuted by him and that we would be delivered from him by the second coming of Jesus Christ you will find this in Catholic theology you will find that in Orthodox theology you will find it in all of the reformers and **you will not find the idea that we are going to escape the Antichrist until approximately a hundred and forty years ago when a 15 year old girl had a revelation and that revelation was picked up by J. N. Darby the founder of the Plymouth Brethren and developed into a form of theology known as dispensational theology** the church for 19 centuries. &mdash; [Dr. Walter Martin (Ph.D., California Coast University)](https://youtu.be/uO0TAHKzPFw?si=qbF7x_gk18zTGVht).

# 💭 Charles Ryrie Made Things Up To Make Dispensationalism Work

I feel just as betrayed as Heiser, as I was also raised in dispensational theology, and held to it for half my life.

> [@9:07](https://youtu.be/_T4AhNUHxZA?si=U38kJ0fV8aX_Ss-d&t=547) ... I'm gonna say this; with a few of them, you really can say things like, they just gotta make stuff up to make it work. **I was raised in classic dispensational thought, that was my first Christian context.** And classic dispensationalism is Charles Ryrie and CI Scofield, those guys. And Ryrie got to the point where he had to... you have to understand; classic dispensationalism, I've been trying to teach you that prophecy is already but not yet. You got both things working. Classic dispensationalism says "there is no already. It's all not yet." And so, when **Ryrie would get cornered on like Kingdom language** and stuff like this, he literally in one of his books, he wanted so badly for the New Covenant to not be fulfilled in the New Testament. That **he said "well then we need to expect a New-New Covenant." Like he just made up a New-New Covenant, like right there in a book.** Okay, can I invent something and have a system too? Is that the new ground rule now? Like you just make one up? I'm going to call my covenant, the Mike Covenant. **You'll see stuff like this happen.** That when you look back on it, it makes you laugh, but like he was serious, he was serious about this. And he was a major figure in biblical scholarship in that tradition.

Dr. Heiser was a master of ancient languages, specifically Old Testament Biblical Hebrew, as well as Ancient Egyptian, and created the KJV, NIV, and NKJV Interlinears for Logos Bible Software. He was far greater than a normal theologian, he was a textual critic.

# 3️⃣ Dispensationalism Effectively Teaches Two Second Comings

> The Rapture is a belief that Jesus Christ will return initially for the church. He will come—but not quite to earth. Here’s how: Jesus will come, and then the church will be taken up to meet him. This view of the rapture is prominent in a system of theology called premillennial dispensationalism. 
>
But here’s the problem: you end up with two second comings. 
>
You get Jesus coming the first time for the church to rapture them away. 
>
Then after a period of tribulation he comes again for the second time. This is the second part of the second coming, second coming 2.B where he comes with the church largely in judgment to rescue those who also became believers during a great period of great tribulation.
>
However, this isn’t what the Bible says about the rapture. The New Testament doesn’t split up the second coming of Jesus along those lines. 
>
Instead, the second coming of Jesus is more singular, more unitary, more comprehensive, more definitive. There is a period of tribulation or trial that comes upon the world. There's apostasy, and there's persecution, the sort of thing spoken about in 1 Thessalonians. Then at the end of that, after a period of tribulation, Christ returns. 
>
It's not that the church is raptured to go meet him, but rather he returns definitively. 
>
As Paul says, he then hands over the kingdom to the Father. This is the moment where Jesus will be by might what he is by right, Lord of all.

# 🌲 The Bible Only Speaks Of One Tree

|Theologies||
|:-:|:-:|
|<span style="color:#F6BE00;">Dispensationalism</span>|The Church is separate from true Israel|
|<span style="color:darkred;">Replacement Theology</span>|The Church has superseded true Israel|
|<span style="color:ForestGreen;">Covenant Theology</span>|The Church is an expansion of true Israel|

> 16 And since Abraham and the other patriarchs were holy, their descendants will also be holy—just as the entire batch of dough is holy because the portion given as an offering is holy. For if the roots of **the tree** are holy, the **branches** will be, too.
>
17 But some of these **branches** from Abraham’s tree—some of the people of Israel—have been broken off. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">And you Gentiles, who were **branches** from a wild olive tree, have been grafted in.</span> So now you also receive the blessing God has promised Abraham and his children, sharing in the rich nourishment from the root of God’s special olive tree. 18 But you must not brag about being grafted in to replace the **branches** that were broken off. You are just a branch, not the root.
>
19 “Well,” you may say, “those **branches** were broken off to make room for me.” 20 Yes, but remember—those **branches** were broken off because they didn’t believe in Christ, and you are there because you do believe. So don’t think highly of yourself, but fear what could happen. 21 For if God did not spare the original **branches**, he won’t spare you either.
>
22 Notice how God is both kind and severe. He is severe toward those who disobeyed, but kind to you if you continue to trust in his kindness. But if you stop trusting, you also will be cut off. 23 And if the people of Israel turn from their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, for God has the power to graft them back into the tree. 24 You, by nature, were a branch cut from a wild olive tree. So if God was willing to do something contrary to nature by grafting you into his cultivated tree, he will be far more eager to graft the original **branches** back into the tree where they belong.
>
&mdash; Romans 11:16-24 NLT

Just some food for thought.

> And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children of Abraham. You are his heirs, and God’s promise to Abraham belongs to you. &mdash; Galatians 3:29 NLT

# ☠️ It Is Appointed Unto Men Once To Die

How will you be raptured when you are destined to die?

> And just as **each person is destined to die once** and after that comes judgment, &mdash; Hebrews 9:27 NLT
