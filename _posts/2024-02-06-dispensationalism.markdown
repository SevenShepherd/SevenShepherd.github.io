Dispensationalism is probably one of the best eschatological systems we have, but despite this, here is a small critique. If I absolutely had to change systems, I'd probably look into Historic Premillennialism, a system held by [Dr. Walter Martin](https://youtu.be/uO0TAHKzPFw?si=qbF7x_gk18zTGVht), and D. A. Carson.

# üî• Dispensational Theology Was Developed From The Vision Of A 15 Year Old Girl In The 1800s. Now That's Strange Fire.

The first 1:20 seconds of this video will floor you if you understand the gravity of what is being said.

> so what I elected to do this evening is something very simple how many have your Bibles good what I'd like to do is to tell you first off that the position I am going to set forth tonight is not new as number one secondly the position I will set forth tonight was believed by the Christian Church for 19 centuries the Church Fathers the Reformers every great theologian in the entire history of the church up until the last 140 years believed that we would see the Anti Christ that we would be persecuted by him and that we would be delivered from him by the second coming of Jesus Christ you will find this in Catholic theology you will find that in Orthodox theology you will find it in all of the reformers and **you will not find the idea that we are going to escape the Antichrist until approximately a hundred and forty years ago when a 15 year old girl had a revelation and that revelation was picked up by J. N. Darby the founder of the Plymouth Brethren and developed into a form of theology known as dispensational theology** the church for 19 centuries. &mdash; [Dr. Walter Martin (Ph.D., California Coast University)](https://youtu.be/uO0TAHKzPFw?si=qbF7x_gk18zTGVht).

# üí≠ Charles Ryrie Made Things Up To Make Dispensationalism Work

I feel just as betrayed as Heiser, as I was also raised in dispensational theology, and held to it for half my life.

> [@9:07](https://youtu.be/_T4AhNUHxZA?si=U38kJ0fV8aX_Ss-d&t=547) ... I'm gonna say this; with a few of them, you really can say things like, they just gotta make stuff up to make it work. **I was raised in classic dispensational thought, that was my first Christian context.** And classic dispensationalism is Charles Ryrie and CI Scofield, those guys. And Ryrie got to the point where he had to... you have to understand; classic dispensationalism, I've been trying to teach you that prophecy is already but not yet. You got both things working. Classic dispensationalism says "there is no already. It's all not yet." And so, when **Ryrie would get cornered on like Kingdom language** and stuff like this, he literally in one of his books, he wanted so badly for the New Covenant to not be fulfilled in the New Testament. That **he said "well then we need to expect a New-New Covenant." Like he just made up a New-New Covenant, like right there in a book.** Okay, can I invent something and have a system too? Is that the new ground rule now? Like you just make one up? I'm going to call my covenant, the Mike Covenant. **You'll see stuff like this happen.** That when you look back on it, it makes you laugh, but like he was serious, he was serious about this. And he was a major figure in biblical scholarship in that tradition.

Dr. Heiser was a master of ancient languages, specifically Old Testament Biblical Hebrew, as well as Ancient Egyptian, and created the KJV, NIV, and NKJV Interlinears for Logos Bible Software. He was far greater than a normal theologian, he was a textual critic.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dispensationalism Effectively Teaches Two Second Comings

> The Rapture is a belief that Jesus Christ will return initially for the church. He will come‚Äîbut not quite to earth. Here‚Äôs how: Jesus will come, and then the church will be taken up to meet him. This view of the rapture is prominent in a system of theology called premillennial dispensationalism. 
>
But here‚Äôs the problem: you end up with two second comings. 
>
You get Jesus coming the first time for the church to rapture them away. 
>
Then after a period of tribulation he comes again for the second time. This is the second part of the second coming, second coming 2.B where he comes with the church largely in judgment to rescue those who also became believers during a great period of great tribulation.
>
However, this isn‚Äôt what the Bible says about the rapture. The New Testament doesn‚Äôt split up the second coming of Jesus along those lines. 
>
Instead, the second coming of Jesus is more singular, more unitary, more comprehensive, more definitive. There is a period of tribulation or trial that comes upon the world. There's apostasy, and there's persecution, the sort of thing spoken about in 1 Thessalonians. Then at the end of that, after a period of tribulation, Christ returns. 
>
It's not that the church is raptured to go meet him, but rather he returns definitively. 
>
As Paul says, he then hands over the kingdom to the Father. This is the moment where Jesus will be by might what he is by right, Lord of all.
