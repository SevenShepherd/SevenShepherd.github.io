There is a lake which burns with fire and brimstone (Re 21:8); where the worm dies not and the fire is not quenched, and the smoke of the torment of those who end up their will ascend up for ever and ever (Mk 9:48; Rv. 14:11 KJV). [**Repent**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Lk 13:3; Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4), turn to Christ (Ac 3:19; 26:20), put your trust in Him for justification (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and know that no one born of God practices or pursues (habitually and continually) lifestyles of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62). If your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), and you truly abide in Christ, you will bear fruit (Jn 15:1-17), you will not practice these things.

> Some of you once lived this way. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. &mdash; 1 Corinthians 6:11 NET

<!-- (cf. 1Jn 1:7; Jn 3:17) -->

<!-- > And his affection for you is even greater, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how **you received him with fear and trembling**. -->
