## By viewing repentance as a ‚ÄúResulting‚Äù fruit of genuine saving faith, you avoid the heresies of legalism and antinomianism

The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

> The call to repent was the first and fundamental summons in the preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2), Jesus (Matt. 4:17), the Twelve (Mark 6:12), Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:38), Paul to the Gentiles (Acts 17:30; 26:20), **and the glorified Christ to five of the seven churches in Asia (Rev. 2:5, 16, 22; 3:3, 19)**. It was part of Jesus‚Äô summary of the gospel that was to be taken to the world (Luke 24:47).

When we teach repentance as [a contrition that produces an inward resolve to turn from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) as Jesus and The Apostles did, we're not teaching that repentance is meritorious of justification, as justification by works would be the heresy of legalism. Instead, we teach that repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith. The distinction must be made between something that merits and earns, and something that comes after and bears fruit. The former would be bad to teach, while the latter is simply the teaching of progressive sanctification and is safe.

Justification is by faith alone, but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, is not true faith. It is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26).

The message of repentance only becomes legalistic if you do not teach it as a fruit of genuine saving faith. It becomes a different and false message if you say that people must merit or earn justification by repentance. That would be a heretical legalistic teaching. The true teaching, is not that it is necessary for justification, but that it is a fruit that comes about **after one is already justified by faith**. Necessarily follows is not meritoriously contributes.

> Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">unless you repent</span></span>. &mdash; Revelation 2:5 ESV

> Therefore repent. If not, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">I will come to you soon <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">and war</span></span> against them with the sword of my mouth. &mdash; Revelation 2:16 ESV

> Look! I am throwing her onto a bed of violent illness, and those who commit adultery with her into terrible suffering, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">unless they repent of her deeds</span>. &mdash; Revelation 2:22 NET

> Therefore, remember what you received and heard, and obey it, and repent. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">If you do not wake up</span>, I will come like a thief, and you will never know at what hour <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">I will come against you</span>.</span> &mdash; Revelation 3:3 NET

> All those I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent! &mdash; Revelation 3:19 NET

> Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague. &mdash; [**Dr. J. I. Packer**](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8) (Ph.D., University of Oxford) [Concise Theology. Chapter 65 Legalism. p. 191.](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A)

> Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism. Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‚Äòfaith apart from observing the law‚Äô, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But **if ‚Äògood works‚Äô (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith**, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, **justifying faith (fiducia) is <span style="font-size:1.2em;">not yet ours</span>**. &mdash; [Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford), Concise Theology. Chapter 59 Works. p. 174.](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo).

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:OrangeRed">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)
