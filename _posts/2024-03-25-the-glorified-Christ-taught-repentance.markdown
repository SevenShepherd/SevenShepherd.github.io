## By viewing repentance as a “Resulting” fruit of genuine saving faith, you avoid the heresies of legalism and antinomianism

The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

> The call to repent was the first and fundamental summons in the preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2), Jesus (Matt. 4:17), the Twelve (Mark 6:12), Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:38), Paul to the Gentiles (Acts 17:30; 26:20), **and the glorified Christ to five of the seven churches in Asia (Rev. 2:5, 16, 22; 3:3, 19)**. It was part of Jesus’ summary of the gospel that was to be taken to the world (Luke 24:47).

When we teach repentance as [a contrition and turning away from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) as Jesus and The Apostles did, we're teaching something that happens during the sanctification phase, not before or during justification. Justification by works is the heresy of legalism. Justification is by faith alone, but a faith that does not grow the fruit of repentance by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, is not true faith. It is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26).

The message of repentance only becomes legalistic if you do not teach it as a fruit of genuine saving faith. It becomes a different and false message of you say that people themselves must repent in order to merit or earn justification. That would be a heretical legalistic teaching. The true teaching, is not that it is necessary for justification, but that it is a fruit that comes about after one is already justified by faith. Necessarily follows is not meritoriously contributes.
