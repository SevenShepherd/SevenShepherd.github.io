title: "☠️ Why those lost in cults and heretical sects always push materials, other than the Bible or lexicons, to indoctrinate you. They pray obsessively with these false teachers and their false systems on a daily basis and will use every opportunity to push them on you until you have to avoid them."

I recently wrote [an article on going systemless](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/) where I recommended the Bible and scholarly tools like lexicons for self-directed study or autodidactism. I showcased the most well vetted and educated leaders for Christ that do not push man-made systems:

> Pick up a Bible, pick up a lexicon it was made for English readers like you. You don't need some false teacher to spin the scriptures to you and indoctrinate you into some man-made system.

The Bible instructs us to *&ldquo;Call no man your teacher&rdquo;* for you have only one teacher, Christ Jesus, and all of you are equal as brothers (Mt 23:8-9). The Bible also says that He gave us teachers (Eph 4:11). This is not a contradiction, it's a paradox. The difference is that a true teacher from God will not be teaching [man-made systems](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/) or human wisdom, instead a teacher from God will teach scripture alone apart from any named man-made system.

> You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and do so correctly, for that is what I am. &mdash; John 13:13 NET

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">8</sup> “Don’t let anyone call you ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one teacher, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters. <sup style="font-weight:bold">9</sup> And don’t address anyone here on earth as ‘Father,’ for only God in heaven is your Father. &mdash; Matthew 23:8-9

Get rid of systematic theologians and those who attempt to interpret scripture for you and replace them with materials produced from [biblical language scholars](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/#Recommended-Materials) who actually know and are educated in the meaning of Koine Greek & Biblical Hebrew words.

- When you can speak on man-made teachings like all the different *'ologies* that come out of systematic theology, but you can't recollect a single parable from Christ. ***YOU ARE INDOCTRINATED***.
- If you hold to non-standard meanings of [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) or faith, and you think its only simple assent or mind change, ***YOU ARE INDOCTRINATED***. 

It's time for many of you to pull your heads out of the theological sand. It's time for you to give the Bible another chance. The world can **never** know God through human wisdom. Remember that theologians are not meant to interpret scripture for you—that right belongs to the Holy Spirit (1Jn 2:27; Jn 14:26;16:13; 2Pe 1:20-21; 1 Cor 2:12-14). Instead, open your Bible and fellowship with Christ.

> And we impart this in words **not taught by human wisdom** but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. 1Cor 2:13 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">20</sup> So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world’s brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. <sup style="font-weight:bold">21</sup> Since <span style="font-weight:bold">God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom</span>, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe. &mdash; 1 Cor 1:20-21

<!-- Not too long ago I wrote an article debunking [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), otherwise known as, the 80s *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* Movement. I explained how this dangerous movement cheapened the glorious grace of our God. After some thought, I realized just how menacing the false teachers propagating it are to the little hearts and minds of our children and I was compelled to warn the masses again against this dangerous deception. -->
