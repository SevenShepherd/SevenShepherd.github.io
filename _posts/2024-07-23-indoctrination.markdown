title: "☠️ Why those lost in cults, heretical sects, and sects always push materials, other than the Bible or lexicons, to indoctrinate you."

Long ago in my early twenties, I remember debating two mormon elders at my dining room table. The content that Dr. Walter Martin provided me completely decimated them in debate on approximately 20 points. I was calm, kind, and well mannered throughout the process.

<!-- in his book *&ldquo;The Kingdom of the Cults&rdquo;*  -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> And the Lord’s slave [*servant or bondservant*] must not engage in heated disputes[*“must not fight” or “must not quarrel.”*] but be kind toward all, an apt teacher, patient, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:24-25 NET

Before the debate, I remember them both getting on their hands and knees on the dining room floor and praying in vain before their defeat.

> We know that God does not listen to [sinners](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/), but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to this one. &mdash; John 9:31 LEB (cf. Proverbs 15:29; Isaiah 1:15)

I remember thinking to myself, I wonder how foolish they look to God, or if he's indifferent to what they are doing on the floor right now, maybe he's offended. What worth are the prayers of those with [a false gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+1%3A6-9%3B+2+Corinthians+11%3A13-15&version=ESV;NET;NLT) I asked myself.

> God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” &mdash; John 4:24 ESV (This emphasizes the importance of worshiping and praying in accordance with the truth)

One thing is for certain, their *&ldquo;prayers&rdquo;* fell on deaf ears as they were defeated by the truth. Something necessary for them to endure if they were to accept sound doctrine.

> For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own [desires](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/#fruit), they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear [new things](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/). 4 And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths. &mdash; 2 Timothy 4:3-4 NET

I feel the same way about those lost in the [80s Chaferanism sect](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), as well as the Jehovah Witnesses cult (Watchtowerites). They *&ldquo;pray&rdquo;* in vain and obsessively with these false teachers and their false systems and organizations on a daily basis and will use every opportunity to push them on you until you have to [avoid them](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/cutting-ties/).

> But false prophets arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies, **even to the point of denying the Master who bought them**. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. 2 And many will follow their [debauched lifestyles](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched). Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. 3 And in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation pronounced long ago [cf. Jd 4 NET] is not sitting idly by; their destruction is not asleep. &mdash; 2 Peter 2:1-3 NET (cf. Matthew 7:15-16; 2 Timothy 3:13)

I pray they will make Christ their teacher once again. As the Bible says, [*&ldquo;Call no man your teacher&rdquo;*](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/). A true teacher does not teach man-made things (i.e. **Calvin**ism, **Arminian**ism, [**Chafer**anism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)).

> **“The first phase of the Reformation was [Amyraldian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/) in the sense that the churches professed a strong view of divine predestination while also affirming a universal perspective on the extent of the atonement.”** &mdash; Dr. Michael F. Bird (Ph.D., University of Queensland), Evangelical Theology, 4.4 The Death of Jesus, 4.4.3.3 Amyraldian View. p. 486.

The *'isms* of the faith should be considered sects of Protestantism, but not heretical sects. Protestantism is the most sound group in existence. It's the baseline and by which all others are measured, apart from [scripture itself](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/).

<!-- that their more well informed family members who hold to sound doctrine will convert to their perversions. -->
