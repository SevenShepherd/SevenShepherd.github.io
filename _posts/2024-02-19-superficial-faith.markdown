# üçé Fruit Grows On Salvation

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em">This message is not legalistic</span>, it is not speaking of meriting or earning your salvation. This is speaking of the fruit of genuine saving faith. This is also not speaking of perfection (1Jn 2:1-3). It is simply saying, that if your faith is not superficial, your life will bare fruit (Gal 5:22-23; John 15:1-17). Justification is by faith alone (Rom. 3:28; Eph 2:8-10), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (Jn 14:15,21).

<!-- > Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">his commandments</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">is a liar, and the truth is not in him</span>, &mdash; 1 John 2:4 ESV -->

> 3 And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. 4 <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">If someone claims, ‚ÄúI know God,‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt obey God‚Äôs commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth.</span> 5 But those who obey God‚Äôs word truly show how completely they love him. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">That is how we know we are living in him.</span> 6 Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did. &mdash; 1 John 2:4 NLT

Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically. A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (John 15:1-17). If a tree was genuinely alive it would bear fruit. It's the fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23). If the fruit isn‚Äôt growing the root is dead (Mt 3:8,10; Jn 15:8; Jas 2:17).

> **Biblical faith is evidence-based.**... **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing. ... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*. p. 136, 218, 313.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#lennox)

Saving faith <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;**does not include**&rdquo;</span> obedience, saving faith <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;**results in**&rdquo;</span> obedience. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts but instead a trust and reliance in Christ. Genuine saving faith will always be accompanied by good works that come <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;**after justification**&rdquo;</span>. Good works and continuing to believe <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;**follow**&rdquo;</span> saving faith (*sola fide*).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But false prophets arose among the people, just as <span style="font-weight:bold;">there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">even to the point of denying the <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Master</span> who bought them</span>. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">many will follow their <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">debauched lifestyles</span></span>. Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. &mdash; [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET)

Beware the false teachers who deny Christ's Lordship, and teach debauched lifestyles, who don't understand the agricultural metaphor of fruit bearing (Gal 5:22-23; **John 15:1-17**). They will lie to you, and attempt to get you to think it's legalistic, when Christ taught this metaphor. Beware the antinomians who use Grace as a license to sin!

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">ungodly men</span> who have turned the grace of our God into a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">license for evil</span></span> and who <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">deny our only <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Master and Lord</span>, Jesus Christ</span>. &mdash; Jude 1:4 NET

Do not confuse &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit, with &ldquo;*included*&rdquo; works based righteousness. Understand [the nuance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-results/) so you can avoid both legalism & antinomianism heresies.

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)
