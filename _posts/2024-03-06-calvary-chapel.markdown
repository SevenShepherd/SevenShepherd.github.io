What do I mean by &ldquo;*depart from scripture.*&rdquo; To clarify, I am not talking about the 'isms of Protestantism. If you lean more Calvinistic, or more Arminian, **you are fine and not what I'm speaking of,** as I myself am ever so slightly more reformed. I'm speaking of heresy, like legalism, antinomianism, pelagianism, semi-pelagianism, etc. I've written this article to get a bird's eye view of Chuck Smith's original teachings, and to provide a resource for those who attend Calvary Chapels, to weigh them in the balances of scripture and it's founders original and sound message.

Chuck Smith taught for 17 years as a Pentecostal pastor before starting the Calvary Chapel. This would explain his **solid understanding of basic protestant beliefs** and avoidance of heresy. Smith grew tired with the competition methods of church growth within the international church of the four square gospel, where he preached. He also desired a more moderate take on Charismatic teachings and incorporated some Baptist elements into his hybrid Pentecostal / Baptist &ldquo;*non-denominational*&rdquo; Calvary Chapel.

While &ldquo;*non-denominational,*&rdquo; Smith held strong positions on the distinctives of Protestantism; they are reminiscent of [Reformed Arminianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/) **with the addition of Eternal Security**. Overall he managed to balance his views into a very moderate stance that &ldquo;*toes the line*&rdquo; between Calvinism and Arminianism.

<a name="faith-alone" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.1 Faith Alone</a>

Justification is by grace through faith alone (Eph 3:8-10; Rom 3:28) ...

<a name="fruit-bearing" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.2 Fruit-Bearing</a>

... but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4; Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

<a name="repentance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.3 Repentance</a>

See [**The True Meaning Of Repentance**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).

Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ. Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).

<!-- We are not to view repentance as something meritorious.  -->

<!-- Repentance is something that happens, after we are justified. -->

<!-- Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified. -->

> You can say that you are sorry for what you have done but if you continue to do it, that is not true repentance. **Real repentance is being so sorry, so contrite, that you do not do it again. You turn away from it and cease doing it.** If a person declares that they have repented of a certain action or sin, and they continue in that same action, there is good reason to doubt the genuineness of the repentance. It is not a true repentance when you continue in that sin. **Repentance is the first step to salvation.** &mdash; [**Chuck Smith**](https://youtu.be/kP8rIIps4Sk?t=130)

<a name="assurance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.4 Assurance of Salvation</a>

It will help you to make the distinction between **(1)** justification, which is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and **(2)** assurance of salvation, which is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT; Jn 14:15,21). &ldquo;*we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.*... *That is how we know we are living in him.*&rdquo;<sup style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/">†</a></sup>

> Do not be deceived, if you are walking after the flesh and involved in the things of the flesh, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you have no assurance of being in the Kingdom of Heaven</span> &mdash; [**Chuck Smith (YouTube Short)**](https://youtube.com/shorts/aBG9kH-z8Q8?si=_jqYQqF6bgbN9TZZ)

The following is an excerpt from Chuck Smith's C2000. We also recommend his topical study on [repentance](https://youtu.be/kP8rIIps4Sk?t=130).

> 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don’t know Him. I really haven’t seen Him. If I really know Him, then I’m gonna be free from the practice of sin.**

> 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. So again, don’t deceive yourself. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">If you are <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">practicing</span> sin, living in sin, you are not of God; you are a part of that rebellion against God, led by Satan.</span>

<a name="depravity" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.5 Total Depravity</a>

[Total Depravity](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/total-depravity/) comes in many flavors: **(1)** There is the total depravity of the Orthodox Calvinists that **entails** total inability, which is paired with unconditional single election; **(2)** There is the depravity of the Arminians that **does not entail** inability which is paired with conditional election. **(3)** Then there is the unique view that Chuck Smith held. it would seem Smith merged the Calvinistic understanding of total depravity with the Arminian view of conditional election. This preserves Grace alone, God's sovereignty, and bases election on foreknowledge of forseen faith. I'm not sure this view is completely stable, but it doesn't seem unsafe, as every aspect is still Protestant.

Does your Calvary Chapel pastor teach [total depravity](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/total-depravity/), or are they instead teaching [Semi-Pelagianism](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/), which was officially condemned as heresy by the Council of Orange in 529 A.D.? Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism [result in a rejection of God’s grace in favor of man’s innate goodness](https://www.gotquestions.org/semi-Pelagianism.html). Chuck Smith avoided these heresies, hopefully your pastor does too. Total depravity protects the teachings of grace alone.

<!-- , however small a spark of goodness it is. Semi-Pelagianism downplays God’s supernatural empowerment and enlightenment. It denies that God’s unmerited favor is necessary for us to begin the process of salvation. The Bible says that, from election to glorification, salvation is completely the work of God (Romans 8:29–30). Semi-Pelagianism is unbiblical and should be rejected. &mdash; [GotQuestions.org -->

> We believe that all are sinners (Romans 3:23) and unable by human performance to earn, deserve, or merit salvation (Titus 3:5). We believe that the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), and that apart from God's grace, no one can be saved (Ephesians 2:8-9). We believe that none are righteous, **or capable of doing good** (Romans 3:10-12), and that **apart from the conviction and regeneration of the Holy Spirit, none can be saved** (John 1:12-13; 16:8-11; 1 Peter 1:23-25). **Mankind is clearly fallen and lost in sin.**

<!-- <span style="font-size:1.3em;">Chuck Missler</span>

> **The concept of total depravity is consistent with Scripture**, but the doctrine of limited atonement, that Jesus did not die for the sins of the whole world, is clearly contrary to Biblical teaching. The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus died for everyone’s sins and that everyone is able to be saved **if they will repent and turn to Christ**. Limited atonement is a non-Biblical doctrine.

<a name="election" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.6 Conditional Election (Wesleyan Foreknowledge)</a>

In both the protestant distinctives of Calvinism and Arminianism, God chooses, but he chooses based upon different things. **(1)** In Arminianism He chooses based on his foreknowledge of foreseen faith, **(2)** whereas in Calvinism it is without regard for foreseen human faith or good works. **(3)** Semi-Pelagianism says that man initiates in salvation, which is contrary to any protestant position and contrary to scripture (Jn 6:44,65).

Does your Calvary Chapel pastor teach &ldquo;*God clearly does choose ...,*&rdquo; or are they instead teaching [Semi-Pelagianism](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/), which was officially condemned as heresy by the Council of Orange in 529 A.D.? Chuck Smith avoided this heresy. 

<!-- <span style="font-size:1.3em;">Chuck Smith</span> -->

> **We believe that God chose the believer** before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4-6), and **based on His foreknowledge**, has **predestined the believer** to be conformed to the image of His Son (Romans 8:29-30). We believe that God offers salvation to all who will call on His name. Romans 10:13 says, &ldquo; For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; We also believe that God calls to Himself those who will believe in His Son, Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 1:9). However, the Bible also teaches that an invitation (or call) is given to all, but only a few accept it. We see this balance throughout scripture. Revelation 22:17 states, &ldquo;... And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&rdquo; 1 Peter 1:2 tells us we are, &ldquo;Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. ...&rdquo; Matthew 22:14 says, <span style="font-weight:bold;">&ldquo;For many are called, but few are chosen (elected).&rdquo;</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">God clearly does choose</span>, but man must also accept God's invitation to salvation.

<!-- <span style="font-size:1.3em;">Chuck Missler</span> -->

<!-- > **Election and predestination are Biblical doctrines.** God knows everything and therefore He cannot be surprised by anything. He is beyond the constraints of mass, acceleration and gravity, therefore He is outside time. He knows, and has known from “eternity past,” who will exercise their free will to accept Him and who will reject Him. The former are “the elect” and the latter are the “non-elect.” Everyone who is not saved will have only himself to blame: God will not send anyone to hell, but many people will choose to go there by exercising their free will to reject Christ.

<a name="atonement" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.7 Unlimited Atonement</a>

Hopefully, your Calvary Chapel doesn't teach the [textless doctrine](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/#bird5.6) of [limited atonement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/). The Bible does not support limited atonement: 1 Jn 2:2; 4:14; Jn 1:9,29; 3:17; 4:42; 12:32; Ac 2:21; Ro 5:6; 1Ti 2:3-4,6; Titus 2:11; 2Cor 5:19; 2Pe 3:9. &ldquo;*Election and predestination are Biblical doctrines.*&rdquo;... &ldquo;*the doctrine of limited atonement, that Jesus did not die for the sins of the whole world, is clearly contrary to Biblical teaching.*&rdquo;<sup><a href="https://www.khouse.org/enews_article/2008/1089">1</a></sup>

> We believe that Jesus Christ died as a propitiation (a satisfaction of the righteous wrath of God against sin) &ldquo;*for the whole world*&rdquo; (1 John 2:2; 4:9-10), and that He redeems and forgives all who will believe in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as their only hope of salvation from sin, death, and hell (Ephesians 1:7; 1 Peter 1:18-19). We believe that eternal life is a gift of God (Romans 6:23), and that &ldquo;*whosoever believeth*&rdquo; in Jesus Christ will not perish, but will have eternal life (John 3:16-18). I Timothy 4:10 says &ldquo;*we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, specially of those that believe.*&rdquo; Hebrews 2:9 states that Jesus, &ldquo;*was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man*&rdquo; The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ was clearly sufficient to save the entire human race.

> under construction

<a name="perseverance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.9 Perseverance of The Saints</a>

This one might be difficult for some to hear, but keep in mind, if you are putting your trust in Christ for salvation, your past doesn't matter. Do not stop trusting in Christ, because we are justified by faith (trust) alone. We also know that faith (trust) is not a work (Romans 4:5). Repent like Christ commanded (Mt 4:17; Ac 17:30), turn away from your apostasy (Ac 3:19; Ac 26:20), and put your faith (trust) in Christ (Mark 1:15). Genuine saving faith will &ldquo;*result*&rdquo; in fruit (John 15:1-17; Gal 5:22-23) progressively, this is how we know we are living in Him (1Jn 2:3-6).

It will help you to make the distinction between **(1)** justification, which is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and **(2)** assurance of salvation, which is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT; Jn 14:15,21). &ldquo;*we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.*... *That is how we know we are living in him.*&rdquo;<sup style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/">†</a></sup>

> PERSEVERANCE
>
We believe that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 8:38-39), and that there is no condemnation to those who are in Jesus Christ (Romans 8:1). We believe that the promise of Jesus in John 10:27-28 is clear: "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand." Jesus said in John 6:37, "him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out." We have this assurance in Philippians 1:6 "Being confident of this very thing, that He who hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." We believe that the Holy Spirit has sealed us unto the day of redemption (Ephesians 1:13-14; 4:30).
>
But we also are deeply concerned over the words of Jesus in Matthew 7:21-23:
>
>>"Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father, who is in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? And in Thy name have cast out devils? And in Thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from Me, ye that work iniquity."
>
Apparently there are many who claim to be believers that in fact are not.
>
Jesus said in Luke 9:62, "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." I Corinthians 6:9-10 insists that "the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God" and warns us not to be deceived. A list is then given of various kinds of sinful lifestyles with an ending remark that they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Similar statements and conclusions are given in Galatians 5:19-21 and Ephesians 5:3-5.
>
Galatians 5:4 says "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace." Colossians 1:22-23 says about Jesus Christ "In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in His sight, if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature that is under heaven, of which I, Paul, am made a minister." II Timothy 2:12 says "if we deny Him, He also will deny us." Hebrews 3:12 says, "Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God." Can true believers ("brethren") depart from the living God? I Timothy 4:1 says that "in the latter times, some shall depart from the faith." II Thessalonians 2:3 speaks of "a falling away" or an apostasy. II Peter 2:20-21 makes these remarkable statements:
>
>>"For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."
>
It is no wonder that Peter says in II Peter 1:10, "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall." We thank God for the encouragement of Jude 24 - "Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy."
>
Maintaining a Bible centered balance in these difficult issues is of great importance. **We do believe in the perseverance of the saints (true believers), but are deeply concerned about sinful lifestyles and rebellious hearts among those who call themselves "Christians."** We don't have all the answers to these matters, but we desire to be faithful to the Lord and His word. If we find ourselves basing our view of salvation on the performance and attitudes of people we become discouraged and concerned. But when we keep our eyes on the Lord, and trust in Him alone and in His power, we say with Peter in I Peter 1:3-9:
>
>>"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to His abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ, whom, having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
>
It is not easy to maintain the unity of the Spirit among us on these matters. It seems that the sovereignty of God and human responsibility are like two parallel lines that do not seem to intersect within our finite minds. God's ways are "past finding out" (Romans 11:33), and the Bible warns us to "lean not unto thy own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5). To say what God says in the Bible - no more and no less - is not always easy, comfortable, or completely understandable. But Scripture tells us that the wisdom from above will be loving and kind toward all, seeking the unity of the believers, not trying to find ways to divide and separate from one another. May God help us all to love each other, to be kind, tenderhearted, forgiving one another as Jesus Christ has forgiven us (Ephesians 4:32)! In difficult doctrinal matters, may we have gracious attitudes and humble hearts, desiring most of all to please Him who has called us to serve Him in the body of Christ. Discussion - YES! Disagreements - YES! Division - NO!

<!-- When a particular position on the Scriptures causes one to become argumentative, legalistic, and divisive, I question the validity of that position. I seek to embrace those things that tend to make me more loving and kind, more forgiving and merciful. I know then that I am becoming more like my Lord. If you have come to a strong personal conviction on one side of a doctrinal issue, please grant us the privilege of first seeing how it has helped you to become more Christ-like in your nature, and then we will judge whether we need to come to that same persuasion. Let us always be certain to look at the fruit of the teaching.
>
Seek those things that produce the loving nature of Jesus in our lives. I would rather have the wrong facts and a right attitude, than right facts and a wrong attitude. God can change my understanding of the facts in a moment, but it often takes a lifetime to effect changes of attitude.

<a name="compatibilist" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.0 Compatibilist View Of Free Will</a>

There are several ways a person can view free will in relation to Biblical teaching. **(1)** Soft-determinism of the Calvinists called &ldquo;*freedom of inclination.*&rdquo; **(2)** Free agency of the Arminians called &ldquo;*Libertarian free will*&rdquo; in which you are so free that you can forfeit salvation. **(3)** The moderately reformed position of &ldquo;*[compatibilism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#carson)*&rdquo; which joins the aforementioned options while maintaining eternal security. **(4)** the Wesleyan-Arminin version of compatibilism called &ldquo;*Molinism*&rdquo;.

3. **Belief in the Gospel**
    - Quickened by the Spirit, the minds of the elect are persuaded of the truths of the Gospel of God’s grace.
4. **Repentance**
    - Likewise enabled by the Spirit the effectually called despise and turn away from all known sins.

You turn away from it and cease doing it.** If a person declares that they have repented of a certain action or sin, and they continue in that same action, there is good reason to doubt the genuineness of the repentance. It is not a true repentance when you continue in that sin. **Repentance is the first step to salvation.** &mdash; [**Chuck Smith**](https://youtu.be/kP8rIIps4Sk?t=130)

5. **Trust in Christ**
    - The effectually called personally commit themselves to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their life.
6. **Regeneration**
    - God creates in justified believers new life, defined as the radical reorientation of the dispositions and affections toward God.
7. **Union with Christ**
    - The Spirit unites newly born saints with Jesus Christ in a vital, spiritual, and indissoluble union. The NT describes this experiential reality by the familiar “in Christ” motif.
8. **Justification**
    - God in turn reckons believing sinners righteous in his sight and bestows upon them the gift of eternal life.
9. **Sanctification**
    - By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.
10. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - See <a href="#perseverance">Perseverance of The Saints</a>.
11. **Glorification**
    - God perfects the final and complete redemption of the believer—body, soul, and spirit—at the Parousia of the Lord Jesus Christ.  -->
