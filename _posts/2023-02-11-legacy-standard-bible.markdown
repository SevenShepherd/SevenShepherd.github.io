<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;color:Black;">Legacy Standard Bible</span>

The Legacy Standard Bible is a worthy update to the NASB '95 & '77, essentially becoming NASB 2021. The 1995 was already considered by scholars as the most literal version of the Bible ever produced. This ministry almost crowned the LSB [*"the ultimate Bible version"*](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-best-bible/) in my article; however, the following simple points below gave the win to the ESV.

> The NASB 1995, NASB 2020, and LSB are all accurate, clear, and readable translations that complement each other by providing a well-rounded Bible translation family. &mdash; [Lockman Foundation](https://www.lockman.org/legacy-standard-bible-lsb/)

<span style="font-size:32px">ü©π</span> <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:24px;color:Black;">Fixes #1 & #2</span>

The Legacy Standard Bible should adopt the DSS & LXX reading, instead of the Masoretic Text reading, in Deut. 32:8 to avoid logic errors. [Israel Wasn‚Äôt Even In Existence When the Most High Divided The Nations!](https://bit.ly/3De5m43)

> My test case for this is Deuteronomy 32:8 and Deuteronomy 32:43. The former should read ‚Äúsons of God‚Äù (ESV; cp. ‚Äúgods‚Äù in NRSV), or something like ‚Äúheavenly beings‚Äù (NET Bible) or ‚Äúheavenly court‚Äù (NLT) instead of ‚Äúsons of Israel.‚Äù Verse 43 should read ‚Äúbow down to Him, all you gods‚Äù (ESV, NRSV) or something akin to it like NLT‚Äôs ‚Äúlet all God‚Äôs angels worship him.‚Äù &mdash; [Dr. Michael S. Heiser](https://drmsh.com/bible-versions/)

The NASB line of bible versions, while extraordinarily literal, are literal to the wrong underlying text in this specific instance, and prove that they are not using our oldest and best manuscripts.

<span style="font-size:32px">ü©π</span> <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:24px;color:Black;">Fix #3</span>

Versions of the bible that call themselves literal or formal equivalent, should have the word "fruit" &mdash; like the ESV has &mdash; instead of "benefit" in Romans 6:22 since this ties into the context of Romans 7:4.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;color:Black;">Conclusion</span>

The LSB, given the fixes above, would be on even footing with the ESV. Not only would it contain the latest readings including those of Jn 1:18 and Jude 1:5 "Jesus", but would exceed the ESV in the sense that it brackets instead of footnotes alternative readings, like Mat 17:20-21, which is preferable. It would also have other great features like the capitalization of text referring to OT passages in the New Testament, and the covenant name Yahweh.

**If the makers of the LSB really wanted to exemplify 2Ti 2:15, not only would they fix these simple issues, but they would provide a version that supplies the translators' notes much like the [NET Bible, Full Notes Edition](https://amzn.to/3WLAgbr).**

As it stands, this ministry can only recommend the [New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs](https://316publishing.com/collections/lsb-nt-with-psalms-and-proverbs/products/lsb-new-testament-with-psalms-and-proverbs-goatskin). Please fix these simple issues and I will personally endorse this version. I sometimes carry a high quality, smaller, lighter, and thinner New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs.
