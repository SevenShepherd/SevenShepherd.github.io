When Jesus taught that people should turn away from their sins in repentance (Acts 3:26; cf. Ac 3:19), the message was one of contrition (2Cor 7:10) and right relationship, not legalism.

<!-- > Therefore repent and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">turn back</span> so that your sins may be wiped out, &mdash; Acts 3:19 NET

>> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">3:19 Repent . . . and turn to God. <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">Repentance is turning away from sin.</span> Faith is turning to God for salvation. See 2:38 and note. times of refreshing. The blessings and glories of the Messianic age, synonymous with “the time . . . for God to restore everything” (v. 21). Though the kingdom of God has been inaugurated through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, it is yet to be consummated in the future. &mdash; The NIV <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Purple;">Biblical Theology Study Bible,</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">165 scholars</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Purple;">(100+ NIV; 65 Study); Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, Yale, California, London, Belfast, Claremont, Denver, Westminister, & Dallas.</span></span> -->

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.

>> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">we can be sure</span> that we know him if we obey his commandments. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">If someone claims, “I know God,” but doesn’t obey God’s commandments, that person is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">a liar</span> and is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">not living in the truth</span>.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> But those who obey God’s word truly show how completely they love him. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">That is how we know we are living in him.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did. &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 NLT ([**article**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/))

Turning away from sin in repentance is not a requirement of justification, it's an observation of sanctification and therefore never legalistic. It's the indwelling of the Holy Spirit that *&ldquo;produces&rdquo;* these changes, and rest assured, if your faith is genuine, they will come (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7).

ℹ️ Disclaimer: Everyone has sin (1 Jn 1:8–10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).
