The quick answer is that this ministry believes, based on the evidence provided, that water baptism isn't necessary for salvation, but it is necessary to obey Christ and get baptized once you're saved by grace through genuine faith. It may not justify, but a justified person will obey God and get baptized.

> ‚ÄúI baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</span> &mdash; Matthew 3:11 ESV

<a name="faith" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">üî• I. You're Saved At The Point Of Genuine Faith</a>

We are saved at the point of saving faith, not at the point of water baptism.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> The Bible specifically states that salvation happens at the moment of true saving faith. Let us not forget that all scripture is the inspired word of God, and God has spoken. (2Ti 3:16 NET)

- <a name="Ephesians2:8-10" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.1 Ephesians 2:8-10</a>

    > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">God saved you by his grace <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">when you believed</span>.</span> And you can‚Äôt take credit for this; it is a gift from God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> For we are God‚Äôs masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago. &mdash; Ephesians 2:8-10 NLT


<a name="thief" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">üî• II. The Thief On The Cross</a>

Jesus saves the dying thief on the cross without baptism. The thief could not be baptized before he died on the cross, but he was certainly saved that day.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> This is why Reformed theology stresses that true saving faith always **results** in obedience and good works **after justification**. We do not say that it **includes** obedience, because that would be works righteousness and no one will make it to heaven based on their own merits (Eph. 2:8-10; Gal. 2:21;5:4; Rom 3:20,28; Gal 2:16; 3:10-12). *Sola fide.*

- <a name="Luke23:43" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">2.1 Luke 23:43</a>

    > And he said to him, ‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.‚Äù &mdash; Luke 23:43

- <a name="cross" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">2.2 The Cross Is Enough</a>

    > While we should preach that all men are commanded to repent and be baptized (Acts 2:38), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">adding any other requirement to salvation by grace becomes "works" in disguise</span>. Even though numerous scriptures speak of the importance of water baptism, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">adding anything to the work of the cross <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">demeans the sacrifice of the Savior</span>. It implies that His finished work <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">wasn't enough</span>.</span> But the Bible makes clear that we are saved by grace, and grace alone (Eph. 2:8,9). Baptism is simply a step of obedience to the Lord following our repentance and confession of sin. Our obedience&mdash;water baptism, prayer, good works, fellowship, witnessing, etc.&mdash;issues from our faith in Christ. Salvation is not based on what we do, but on Who we have: "He who has the Son has life" (1 John 5:12). &mdash; [Ray Comfort (The Evidence Study Bible), p. 1388.](https://amzn.to/3MvN1o6)

<a name="nicodemus" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">üî• III. Jesus Expects Nicodemus To Understand</a>

The context is imperative. It is crystal clear that Jesus expects Nicodemus to understand what he means, yet, at this point in time, Nicodemus could not have known what Christian baptism was; a concept that would have had no relevance to Nicodemus.<sup><a href="#btsb_cite">5</a></sup>

Put another way, Jesus expects Nicodemus to understand this concept from the OT scriptures, where there was no such thing as Christian baptism, ergo, whatever Jesus was speaking of must have been a concept derived from passages in the Old Testament. This rules out Christian baptism. <sup><a href="#net_cite">2</a></sup>

It seems clear then, that if this is not alluding to water baptism, that it would then be speaking about the necessity of being born from above by the regenerating work of the Spirit, as evidenced by the context of vv. 7-8.<sup><a href="#net_cite">2</a></sup> Regeneration is a separate concept, it is the concept of being born again.

    > **3:5** born of water and the Spirit. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Parallel with ‚Äúborn again‚Äù (vv. 3, 7)</span> and ‚Äúborn of the Spirit‚Äù (v. 8), emphasizing a (single) <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Spirit-produced birth</span>. This makes several interpretations unlikely: (**1**) that ‚Äúborn of water‚Äù refers to natural birth (no ancient sources picture natural birth as ‚Äúfrom water,‚Äù where ‚Äúwater‚Äù is the amniotic fluid that breaks before childbirth); <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">(**2**) that ‚Äúborn of water‚Äù refers to Christian baptism (these words would have had <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:red;">no relevance to Nicodemus</span> at the time);</span> (**3**) that ‚Äúborn of water‚Äù refers to John‚Äôs baptism (also, vv. 9‚Äì12 then do not logically follow); (**4**) that ‚Äúthe Spirit‚Äù refers to the Word of God (John‚Äôs other metaphoric uses of ‚Äúwater‚Äù in this Gospel refer to Spirit-produced life [4:14; 7:38‚Äì39], not to God‚Äôs Word). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">The most plausible interpretation of ‚Äúborn of water and the Spirit‚Äù is the purifying and transforming new birth.</span> Since <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">Jesus expects Nicodemus to understand what he means (vv. 7, 10)</span>, the background to the concept is previous Scripture. Water in the OT often refers to renewal or cleansing, and the most significant OT connection bringing together water and spirit is Ezek 36:25‚Äì27, where water cleanses from impurity and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">the Spirit transforms hearts</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">So ‚Äúborn of water and the Spirit‚Äù signals <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">a new birth</span> that cleanses and transforms.</span> &mdash; <a href="#btsb_cite">NIV Biblical Theology Study Bible<sup>5</sup></a>

    > JOHN‚ÄîNOTE ON 3:3‚Äì6 This discussion of the need for <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">spiritual rebirth</span> further develops the earlier reference to the ‚Äúchildren of God‚Äù who are ‚Äúborn of God‚Äù (1:12‚Äì13; cf. 8:39‚Äì58; 11:51‚Äì52). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">The phrase born of water and the Spirit in 3:5 refers to <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">spiritual birth</span></span>, which cleanses from sin and brings spiritual transformation and renewal. Water here does not refer to the water of physical birth, nor is it likely that it refers to baptism. The background is probably Ezek. 36:25‚Äì27, where God promises, ‚ÄúI will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean. ‚Ä¶ And I will give you a new heart. ‚Ä¶ And I will put my Spirit within you.‚Äù For further discussion of being <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">born again</span>, see 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18. The kingdom of God, a major topic in the other Gospels, is mentioned in John only in 3:3, 5 (see the reference to Jesus‚Äô kingdom in John 18:36). &mdash; <a href="#esvsb_cite">ESV Study Bible<sup>1</sup></a>

- <a name="logos_commentary" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">3.1.3 LOGOS Faithlife Study Bible Commentary</a>

    > **3:5 born of water and spirit** Jesus elaborates on the meaning of being born from above in v. 3, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">emphasizing the need for <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">spiritual birth</span></span> (see note on v. 3). The ot overtones of the Greek phrase used here, literally rendered as ‚Äúborn of water and spirit,‚Äù are meant to make Nicodemus realize that Jesus is inaugurating the age of renewal anticipated by the ot prophets (Joel 2:28; Isa 32:15; 44:3; Ezek 11:19‚Äì20; 36:25‚Äì27). In this regard, Ezek 36:25‚Äì27 clearly combines the imagery of cleansing by water with inner renewal by the spirit (pneuma) from God.
    >> Interpretations of this verse often attempt to connect Jesus‚Äô statement with some type of water baptism, understanding references to both physical and spiritual rebirth symbolized by baptism. The phrase ‚Äúborn of water and spirit‚Äù could refer to two births, since John 3:6 contrasts being born of the flesh with being born of the Spirit. However, a reference to the Christian sacrament of baptism is unlikely. The mention of water, though, may allude to John‚Äôs baptism, which emphasizes repentance from sin. The danger with understanding ‚Äúborn of water‚Äù as a reference to water baptism is that it could be misconstrued as making baptism a requirement for salvation. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Any secondary implications about water baptism should be understood as symbolic of spiritual rebirth, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not as a necessary part of salvation</span>.</span> &mdash; <a href="#logos_cite">LOGOS Faithlife Study Bible<sup>4</sup></a>

Both occur in contexts that deal with the future restoration of Israel as a nation prior to the establishment of the messianic kingdom. It is therefore particularly appropriate that Jesus should introduce them in a conversation about entering the kingdom of God. Note that the Greek word œÄŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ is anarthrous (has no article) in v. 5. This does not mean that spirit in the verse should be read as a direct reference to the Holy Spirit, but that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">both water and wind are figures (based on passages <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">in the OT</span>, which Nicodemus, the teacher of Israel <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">should have known</span>) that represent the <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">regenerating work</span> of the Spirit</span> in the lives of men and women. &mdash; <a href="#net_cite">Net Bible Full Notes Edition<sup>2</sup></a> [[online]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A5-10&version=NET)

Where there is repentance, there is first genuine saving faith, and where there is salvation by grace through faith, there is a **resulting** obedience: baptism, prayer, good works, fellowship, witnessing, etc. It's not the baptism that saves, but the inward genuine faith and repentance that God grants to the regenerate (Phil. 1:29 NET; Ac 11:18; 2Ti 2:25 NET), **resulting** in an outward showing of obedience that includes baptism and good works that come **after jutification**.

(On baptism ‚Äúin the name of Jesus Christ,‚Äù see note on Acts 10:48.) The gospel can be summarized in different ways. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Sometimes faith alone is named as the one thing necessary for salvation (see John 3:16; Acts 16:31; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 2:8‚Äì9), other times repentance alone is named (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10), and sometimes both are named (Acts 20:21).</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Genuine faith always involves repentance</span>, and vice versa. Repentance includes a change of mind that ends up trusting God (i.e., having faith). On repentance, see notes on Matt. 3:2; 3:5‚Äì6. The gift of the Holy Spirit does not mean some specific spiritual ‚Äúgift‚Äù as in 1 Corinthians 12‚Äì14 but rather the gift of the Spirit himself, coming to dwell within the believer. &mdash; <a href="#esvsb_cite">ESV Study Bible<sup>1</sup></a>

    > **a.** Acts 2:38 tn The verb is a third person imperative, but the common translation ‚Äúlet each of you be baptized‚Äù obscures the imperative force in English, since it sounds more like a permissive (‚Äúeach of you may be baptized‚Äù) to the average English reader.
    >
    **c.** Acts 2:38 tn There is debate over the meaning of Œµ·º∞œÇ in the prepositional phrase Œµ·º∞œÇ ·ºÑœÜŒµœÉŒπŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒπ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ΩëŒº·ø∂ŒΩ (eis aphesin t≈çn hamarti≈çn hum≈çn, ‚Äúfor/because of/with reference to the forgiveness of your sins‚Äù). Although a causal sense has been argued, it is difficult to maintain here. ExSyn 369-71 discusses at least four other ways of dealing with the passage: (1) The baptism referred to here is physical only, and Œµ·º∞œÇ has the meaning of ‚Äúfor‚Äù or ‚Äúunto.‚Äù Such a view suggests that salvation is based on works‚Äîan idea that runs counter to the theology of Acts, namely: (a) repentance often precedes baptism (cf. Acts 3:19; 26:20), and (b) salvation is entirely a gift of God, not procured via water baptism (Acts 10:43 [cf. v. 47]; 13:38-39, 48; 15:11; 16:30-31; 20:21; 26:18); (2) The baptism referred to here is spiritual only. Although such a view fits well with the theology of Acts, it does not fit well with the obvious meaning of ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù in Acts‚Äîespecially in this text (cf. 2:41); (3) The text should be repunctuated in light of the shift from second person plural to third person singular back to second person plural again. The idea then would be, ‚ÄúRepent for/with reference to your sins, and let each one of you be baptized‚Ä¶‚Äù Such a view is an acceptable way of handling Œµ·º∞œÇ, but its subtlety and awkwardness count against it; (4) Finally, it is possible that to a first-century Jewish audience (as well as to Peter), the idea of baptism might incorporate both the spiritual reality and the physical symbol. That Peter connects both closely in his thinking is clear from other passages such as Acts 10:47 and 11:15-16. If this interpretation is correct, then Acts 2:38 is saying very little about the specific theological relationship between the symbol and the reality, only that historically they were viewed together. One must look in other places for a theological analysis. For further discussion see R. N. Longenecker, ‚ÄúActs,‚Äù EBC 9:283-85; B. Witherington, Acts, 154-55; F. F. Bruce, The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary, 129-30; BDAG 290 s.v. Œµ·º∞œÇ 4.f.

At first glance I can see that many may confuse this verse for water baptism; however, it's clear that this is speaking of regeneration. The most ironic thing about attempting to use this verse to say that baptism saves, is the very first sentence which negates it: <span style="font-style:italic;color:#828282;">&ldquo;he saved us, <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">not because of works</span> done by us...&rdquo;</span> works like baptism!

    > 1 PETER‚ÄîNOTE ON 3:21 A comparison is drawn between salvation in the ark and baptism. In both instances, believers are saved through the waters of judgment, since baptism portrays salvation through judgment. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">The mere mechanical act of baptism <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">does not save</span>, for Peter explicitly says, ‚Äúnot as a removal of dirt from the body,‚Äù meaning that the passing of water over the body <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">does not cleanse anyone</span>.</span> Baptism saves you because it represents inward faith, as evidenced by one‚Äôs appeal to God for the forgiveness of one‚Äôs sins (for a good conscience). Furthermore, baptism ‚Äúsaves‚Äù only insofar as it is grounded in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Baptism is a visual representation of the fact that Christians are clothed with Christ (cf. Gal. 3:27), and in union with Christ they share his victory over sin. Though Christians have disagreed about the proper mode of water baptism beginning in the early history of the church, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Christians have generally agreed (irrespective of denominational differences) that water baptism is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold">an outward sign of the inward reality of regeneration</span>, which is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold">the result of the work of the Holy Spirit</span> (cf.

    > 3:21 this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you. Baptism saves only in the sense that it represents what Christ has achieved. The waters of the Noahic flood symbolize baptism, and baptism is the sign and seal of salvation ‚Äúby the resurrection of Jesus Christ‚Äù (see Rom 6:4). the pledge of a clear conscience. Baptism is not merely a religious ritual that washes the body; it is one‚Äôs pledge to God to live righteously from that time on, which results in a clear conscience before him. Peter reminds his readers of the pledge of their baptism at a time when they are facing suffering because of Christ and are tempted to turn away from the Lord.

<a name="conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">üî• X. Conclusion</a>

It is abundantly clear that baptism is not a requirement of salvation. Our obedience&mdash;water baptism, prayer, good works, fellowship, witnessing, etc.&mdash;issues forth from our faith in Christ. This is why Reformed theology stresses that true saving faith always **results** in obedience and good works **after justification**. We do not say that it **includes** obedience, because that would be works righteousness and no one will make it to heaven based on their own merits (Eph. 2:8-10; Gal. 2:21;5:4; Rom 3:20,28; Gal 2:16; 3:10-12). *Sola fide.*

> While we recognize that Jesus commanded baptism (Matt. 28:19), as did the apostles (Acts 2:38), we should not say that baptism is necessary for salvation. ... To say that baptism or any other action is necessary for salvation is to say that we are not justified by faith alone but by faith plus a certain "work," the work of baptism. The apostle Paul would have opposed the idea... Baptism, then, is not necessary for salvation, But it is necessary if we are to be obedient to Christ, for he commanded baptism for all who believe in him. &mdash; <a href="#grudem">Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster Theological Seminary)<sup>9</sup></a>
