The quick answer is that this ministry believes, based on the evidence provided, that water baptism isn't necessary for salvation, but it is necessary to obey Christ and get baptized once you're saved by grace through genuine faith. It may not justify, but a justified person will obey God and get baptized.

> “I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</span> &mdash; Matthew 3:11 ESV

<a name="faith" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥 I. You're Saved At The Point Of Genuine Faith</a>

We are saved at the point of saving faith, not at the point of water baptism.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> The Bible specifically states that salvation happens at the moment of true saving faith. Let us not forget that all scripture is the inspired word of God, and God has spoken. (2Ti 3:16 NET)

- <a name="Ephesians2:8-10" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.1 Ephesians 2:8-10</a>

    > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">God saved you by his grace <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">when you believed</span>.</span> And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago. &mdash; Ephesians 2:8-10 NLT


<a name="thief" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥 II. The Thief On The Cross</a>

Jesus saves the dying thief on the cross without baptism. The thief could not be baptized before he died on the cross, but he was certainly saved that day.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> This is why Reformed theology stresses that true saving faith always **results** in obedience and good works **after justification**. We do not say that it **includes** obedience, because that would be works righteousness and no one will make it to heaven based on their own merits (Eph. 2:8-10; Gal. 2:21;5:4; Rom 3:20,28; Gal 2:16; 3:10-12). *Sola fide.*

    > And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.” &mdash; Luke 23:43

- <a name="cross" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">2.2 The Cross Is Enough</a>

    > While we should preach that all men are commanded to repent and be baptized (Acts 2:38), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">adding any other requirement to salvation by grace becomes "works" in disguise</span>. Even though numerous scriptures speak of the importance of water baptism, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">adding anything to the work of the cross <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">demeans the sacrifice of the Savior</span>. It implies that His finished work <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">wasn't enough</span>.</span> But the Bible makes clear that we are saved by grace, and grace alone (Eph. 2:8,9). Baptism is simply a step of obedience to the Lord following our repentance and confession of sin. Our obedience&mdash;water baptism, prayer, good works, fellowship, witnessing, etc.&mdash;issues from our faith in Christ. Salvation is not based on what we do, but on Who we have: "He who has the Son has life" (1 John 5:12). &mdash; [Ray Comfort (The Evidence Study Bible), p. 1388.](https://amzn.to/3MvN1o6)

<a name="nicodemus" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥 III. Jesus Expects Nicodemus To Understand</a>

The context is imperative. It is crystal clear that Jesus expects Nicodemus to understand what he means, yet, at this point in time, Nicodemus could not have known what Christian baptism was; a concept that would have had no relevance to Nicodemus.<sup><a href="#btsb_cite">5</a></sup>

Put another way, Jesus expects Nicodemus to understand this concept from the OT scriptures, where there was no such thing as Christian baptism, ergo, whatever Jesus was speaking of must have been a concept derived from passages in the Old Testament. This rules out Christian baptism. <sup><a href="#net_cite">2</a></sup>

It seems clear then, that if this is not alluding to water baptism, that it would then be speaking about the necessity of being born from above by the regenerating work of the Spirit, as evidenced by the context of vv. 7-8.<sup><a href="#net_cite">2</a></sup> Regeneration is a separate concept, it is the concept of being born again.

    > **3:5** born of water and the Spirit. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Parallel with “born again” (vv. 3, 7)</span> and “born of the Spirit” (v. 8), emphasizing a (single) <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Spirit-produced birth</span>. This makes several interpretations unlikely: (**1**) that “born of water” refers to natural birth (no ancient sources picture natural birth as “from water,” where “water” is the amniotic fluid that breaks before childbirth); <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">(**2**) that “born of water” refers to Christian baptism (these words would have had <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:red;">no relevance to Nicodemus</span> at the time);</span> (**3**) that “born of water” refers to John’s baptism (also, vv. 9–12 then do not logically follow); (**4**) that “the Spirit” refers to the Word of God (John’s other metaphoric uses of “water” in this Gospel refer to Spirit-produced life [4:14; 7:38–39], not to God’s Word). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">The most plausible interpretation of “born of water and the Spirit” is the purifying and transforming new birth.</span> Since <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">Jesus expects Nicodemus to understand what he means (vv. 7, 10)</span>, the background to the concept is previous Scripture. Water in the OT often refers to renewal or cleansing, and the most significant OT connection bringing together water and spirit is Ezek 36:25–27, where water cleanses from impurity and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">the Spirit transforms hearts</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">So “born of water and the Spirit” signals <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">a new birth</span> that cleanses and transforms.</span> &mdash; <a href="#btsb_cite">NIV Biblical Theology Study Bible<sup>5</sup></a>

    > JOHN—NOTE ON 3:3–6 This discussion of the need for <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">spiritual rebirth</span> further develops the earlier reference to the “children of God” who are “born of God” (1:12–13; cf. 8:39–58; 11:51–52). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">The phrase born of water and the Spirit in 3:5 refers to <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">spiritual birth</span></span>, which cleanses from sin and brings spiritual transformation and renewal. Water here does not refer to the water of physical birth, nor is it likely that it refers to baptism. The background is probably Ezek. 36:25–27, where God promises, “I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean. … And I will give you a new heart. … And I will put my Spirit within you.” For further discussion of being <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">born again</span>, see 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18. The kingdom of God, a major topic in the other Gospels, is mentioned in John only in 3:3, 5 (see the reference to Jesus’ kingdom in John 18:36). &mdash; <a href="#esvsb_cite">ESV Study Bible<sup>1</sup></a>

    > **3:5 born of water and spirit** Jesus elaborates on the meaning of being born from above in v. 3, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">emphasizing the need for <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">spiritual birth</span></span> (see note on v. 3). The ot overtones of the Greek phrase used here, literally rendered as “born of water and spirit,” are meant to make Nicodemus realize that Jesus is inaugurating the age of renewal anticipated by the ot prophets (Joel 2:28; Isa 32:15; 44:3; Ezek 11:19–20; 36:25–27). In this regard, Ezek 36:25–27 clearly combines the imagery of cleansing by water with inner renewal by the spirit (pneuma) from God.
    >> Interpretations of this verse often attempt to connect Jesus’ statement with some type of water baptism, understanding references to both physical and spiritual rebirth symbolized by baptism. The phrase “born of water and spirit” could refer to two births, since John 3:6 contrasts being born of the flesh with being born of the Spirit. However, a reference to the Christian sacrament of baptism is unlikely. The mention of water, though, may allude to John’s baptism, which emphasizes repentance from sin. The danger with understanding “born of water” as a reference to water baptism is that it could be misconstrued as making baptism a requirement for salvation. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Any secondary implications about water baptism should be understood as symbolic of spiritual rebirth, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not as a necessary part of salvation</span>.</span> &mdash; <a href="#logos_cite">LOGOS Faithlife Study Bible<sup>4</sup></a>

Both occur in contexts that deal with the future restoration of Israel as a nation prior to the establishment of the messianic kingdom. It is therefore particularly appropriate that Jesus should introduce them in a conversation about entering the kingdom of God. Note that the Greek word πνεύματος is anarthrous (has no article) in v. 5. This does not mean that spirit in the verse should be read as a direct reference to the Holy Spirit, but that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">both water and wind are figures (based on passages <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">in the OT</span>, which Nicodemus, the teacher of Israel <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">should have known</span>) that represent the <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">regenerating work</span> of the Spirit</span> in the lives of men and women. &mdash; <a href="#net_cite">Net Bible Full Notes Edition<sup>2</sup></a> [[online]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A5-10&version=NET)

    > MARK—NOTE ON 16:9–20 “Longer Ending of Mark.” Some ancient manuscripts of Mark’s Gospel contain these verses and others do not, which presents a puzzle for scholars who specialize in the history of such manuscripts. This longer ending is missing from various old and reliable Greek manuscripts (esp. Sinaiticus and Vaticanus), as well as numerous early Latin, Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian manuscripts. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">Early church fathers</span> (e.g., Origen and Clement of Alexandria) <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">did not</span> appear to <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">know of these verses</span>.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Eusebius and Jerome state that this section is missing in most manuscripts available at their time.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">And some manuscripts that contain vv. 9–20 indicate that older manuscripts lack the section.</span> On the other hand, some early and many later manuscripts (such as the manuscripts known as A, C, and D) contain vv. 9–20, and many church fathers (such as Irenaeus) evidently knew of these verses.

In summary, vv. 9–20 should be read with caution. As in many translations, the editors of the esv have placed the section within brackets, showing their doubts as to whether it was originally part of what Mark wrote, but also recognizing its long history of acceptance by many in the church. The content of vv. 9–20 is best explained by reference to other passages in the Gospels and the rest of the NT. (Most of its content is found elsewhere, and no point of doctrine is affected by the absence or presence of vv. 9–20.) With particular reference to v. 18, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">there is no command to pick up serpents or to drink deadly poison</span>; there is merely a promise of protection as found in other parts of the NT (see Acts 28:3–4; James 5:13–16).

Where there is repentance, there is first genuine saving faith, and where there is salvation by grace through faith, there is a **resulting** obedience: baptism, prayer, good works, fellowship, witnessing, etc. It's not the baptism that saves, but the inward genuine faith and repentance that God grants to the regenerate (Phil. 1:29 NET; Ac 11:18; 2Ti 2:25 NET), **resulting** in an outward showing of obedience that includes baptism and good works that come **after jutification**.

The gospel can be summarized in different ways. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Sometimes faith alone is named as the one thing necessary for salvation (see John 3:16; Acts 16:31; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 2:8–9), other times repentance alone is named (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10), and sometimes both are named (Acts 20:21).</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Genuine faith always involves repentance</span>, and vice versa.

    > **a.** Acts 2:38 tn The verb is a third person imperative, but the common translation “let each of you be baptized” obscures the imperative force in English, since it sounds more like a permissive (“each of you may be baptized”) to the average English reader.
    >
    **c.** Acts 2:38 tn There is debate over the meaning of εἰς in the prepositional phrase εἰς ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν (eis aphesin tōn hamartiōn humōn, “for/because of/with reference to the forgiveness of your sins”). Although a causal sense has been argued, it is difficult to maintain here. ExSyn 369-71 discusses at least four other ways of dealing with the passage: (1) The baptism referred to here is physical only, and εἰς has the meaning of “for” or “unto.” Such a view suggests that salvation is based on works—an idea that runs counter to the theology of Acts, namely: (a) repentance often precedes baptism (cf. Acts 3:19; 26:20), and (b) salvation is entirely a gift of God, not procured via water baptism (Acts 10:43 [cf. v. 47]; 13:38-39, 48; 15:11; 16:30-31; 20:21; 26:18); (2) The baptism referred to here is spiritual only. Although such a view fits well with the theology of Acts, it does not fit well with the obvious meaning of “baptism” in Acts—especially in this text (cf. 2:41); (3) The text should be repunctuated in light of the shift from second person plural to third person singular back to second person plural again. The idea then would be, “Repent for/with reference to your sins, and let each one of you be baptized…” Such a view is an acceptable way of handling εἰς, but its subtlety and awkwardness count against it; (4) Finally, it is possible that to a first-century Jewish audience (as well as to Peter), the idea of baptism might incorporate both the spiritual reality and the physical symbol. That Peter connects both closely in his thinking is clear from other passages such as Acts 10:47 and 11:15-16. If this interpretation is correct, then Acts 2:38 is saying very little about the specific theological relationship between the symbol and the reality, only that historically they were viewed together. One must look in other places for a theological analysis. For further discussion see R. N. Longenecker, “Acts,” EBC 9:283-85; B. Witherington, Acts, 154-55; F. F. Bruce, The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary, 129-30; BDAG 290 s.v. εἰς 4.f.

<a name="washing" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥 VIII. By The Washing Of Regeneration</a>

At first glance I can see that many may confuse this verse for water baptism; however, it's clear that this is speaking of regeneration. The most ironic thing about attempting to use this verse to say that baptism saves, is the very first sentence which negates it: <span style="font-style:italic;color:#828282;">&ldquo;he saved us, <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">not because of works</span> done by us...&rdquo;</span> works like baptism!

    > TITUS—NOTE ON 3:5 The transformation described in vv. 3–7 (formerly … but now) is not based on human effort. “We … were once enslaved” (v. 3) but he saved us. God must act before salvation occurs. Salvation comes not because of works but by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.

However, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">in this context human deeds are clearly downplayed <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">(“not because of works”)</span></span> and the emphasis is on divine action and initiative (“he saved us”). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">The “washing” described here is the spiritual cleansing, which is outwardly symbolized in baptism.</span>

    > 1 PETER—NOTE ON 3:21 A comparison is drawn between salvation in the ark and baptism. In both instances, believers are saved through the waters of judgment, since baptism portrays salvation through judgment. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">The mere mechanical act of baptism <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">does not save</span>, for Peter explicitly says, “not as a removal of dirt from the body,” meaning that the passing of water over the body <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">does not cleanse anyone</span>.</span> Baptism saves you because it represents inward faith, as evidenced by one’s appeal to God for the forgiveness of one’s sins (for a good conscience). Furthermore, baptism “saves” only insofar as it is grounded in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Baptism is a visual representation of the fact that Christians are clothed with Christ (cf. Gal. 3:27), and in union with Christ they share his victory over sin. Though Christians have disagreed about the proper mode of water baptism beginning in the early history of the church, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Christians have generally agreed (irrespective of denominational differences) that water baptism is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold">an outward sign of the inward reality of regeneration</span>, which is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold">the result of the work of the Holy Spirit</span> (cf. John 3:5, 8; Titus 3:5), and which may be <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold">received only by grace through faith (see Eph. 2:8)</span>.</span>

- <a name="btsb_commentary_1Pe3" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">9.1.3 NIV Biblical Theology Study</a>

    > 3:21 this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you. Baptism saves only in the sense that it represents what Christ has achieved. The waters of the Noahic flood symbolize baptism, and baptism is the sign and seal of salvation “by the resurrection of Jesus Christ” (see Rom 6:4). the pledge of a clear conscience. Baptism is not merely a religious ritual that washes the body; it is one’s pledge to God to live righteously from that time on, which results in a clear conscience before him. Peter reminds his readers of the pledge of their baptism at a time when they are facing suffering because of Christ and are tempted to turn away from the Lord.

<a name="conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥 X. Conclusion</a>

It is abundantly clear that baptism is not a requirement of salvation. Our obedience&mdash;water baptism, prayer, good works, fellowship, witnessing, etc.&mdash;issues forth from our faith in Christ. This is why Reformed theology stresses that true saving faith always **results** in obedience and good works **after justification**. We do not say that it **includes** obedience, because that would be works righteousness and no one will make it to heaven based on their own merits (Eph. 2:8-10; Gal. 2:21;5:4; Rom 3:20,28; Gal 2:16; 3:10-12). *Sola fide.*

> While we recognize that Jesus commanded baptism (Matt. 28:19), as did the apostles (Acts 2:38), we should not say that baptism is necessary for salvation. ... To say that baptism or any other action is necessary for salvation is to say that we are not justified by faith alone but by faith plus a certain "work," the work of baptism. The apostle Paul would have opposed the idea... Baptism, then, is not necessary for salvation, But it is necessary if we are to be obedient to Christ, for he commanded baptism for all who believe in him. &mdash; <a href="#grudem">Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster Theological Seminary)<sup>9</sup></a>
