<a name="faith" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥💧 I. You're Saved At The Point Of Genuine Faith</a>

We are saved at the point of saving faith, not at the point of water baptism.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> The Bible specifically states that salvation happens at the moment of true saving faith. Let us not forget that all scripture is the inspired word of God, and God has spoken. (2Ti 3:16 NET)

- <a name="Ephesians2:8-10" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.1 Ephesians 2:8-10</a>

    > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">God saved you by his grace <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">when you believed</span>.</span> And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago. &mdash; Ephesians 2:8-10 NLT


<a name="thief" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥💧 II. The Thief On The Cross</a>

Jesus saves the dying thief on the cross without baptism. The thief could not be baptized before he died on the cross, but he was certainly saved that day.<sup><a href="#grudem">9</a></sup> This is why Reformed theology stresses that true saving faith always **results** in obedience and good works **after justification**. We do not say that it **includes** obedience, because that would be works righteousness and no one will make it to heaven based on their own merits (Eph. 2:8-10; Gal. 2:21;5:4; Rom 3:20,28; Gal 2:16; 3:10-12). *Sola fide.*

- <a name="Luke23:43" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">2.1 Luke 23:43</a>

    > And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.” &mdash; Luke 23:43

- <a name="cross" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">2.2 The Cross Is Enough</a>

    > While we should preach that all men are commanded to repent and be baptized (Acts 2:38), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">adding any other requirement to salvation by grace becomes "works" in disguise</span>. Even though numerous scriptures speak of the importance of water baptism, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">adding anything to the work of the cross <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">demeans the sacrifice of the Savior</span>. It implies that His finished work <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">wasn't enough</span>.</span> But the Bible makes clear that we are saved by grace, and grace alone (Eph. 2:8,9). Baptism is simply a step of obedience to the Lord following our repentance and confession of sin. Our obedience&mdash;water baptism, prayer, good works, fellowship, witnessing, etc.&mdash;issues from our faith in Christ. Salvation is not based on what we do, but on Who we have: "He who has the Son has life" (1 John 5:12). &mdash; [Ray Comfort (The Evidence Study Bible), p. 1388.](https://amzn.to/3MvN1o6)

<a name="nicodemus" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥💧 III. Jesus Expects Nicodemus To Understand</a>

The context is imperative. It is crystal clear that Jesus expects Nicodemus to understand what he means, yet, at this point in time, Nicodemus could not have known what John's water baptism was.<sup><a href="#btsb_cite">5</a></sup>

- <a name="John3:5,7,10" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">3.1 John 3:5,7,10</a>

    > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> Jesus replied, “I assure you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">and the Spirit</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> Humans can reproduce only human life, but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">the Holy Spirit gives birth to spiritual life</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> So don’t be surprised when I say, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">‘You must be <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:blue;">born again</span>.’</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can’t tell where it comes from or where it is going, so <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">you can’t explain how people are <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:blue;">born of the Spirit</span></span>.” <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> “How are these things possible?” Nicodemus asked. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Jesus replied, “You are a respected Jewish teacher, and yet <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">you don’t understand these things?</span></span> &mdash; John3:5,7,10 NLT  

- <a name="btsb_commentary" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">3.1.1 NIV Biblical Theology Study Bible</a>

    > **3:5** born of water and the Spirit. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">Parallel with “born again” (vv. 3, 7)</span> and “born of the Spirit” (v. 8), emphasizing a (single) <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">Spirit-produced birth</span>. This makes several interpretations unlikely: (**1**) that “born of water” refers to natural birth (no ancient sources picture natural birth as “from water,” where “water” is the amniotic fluid that breaks before childbirth); <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">(**2**) that “born of water” refers to Christian baptism (these words would have had <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:red;">no relevance to Nicodemus</span> at the time);</span> (**3**) that “born of water” refers to John’s baptism (also, vv. 9–12 then do not logically follow); (**4**) that “the Spirit” refers to the Word of God (John’s other metaphoric uses of “water” in this Gospel refer to Spirit-produced life [4:14; 7:38–39], not to God’s Word). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">The most plausible interpretation of “born of water and the Spirit” is the purifying and transforming new birth.</span> Since <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:blue;">Jesus expects Nicodemus to understand what he means (vv. 7, 10)</span>, the background to the concept is previous Scripture. Water in the OT often refers to renewal or cleansing, and the most significant OT connection bringing together water and spirit is Ezek 36:25–27, where water cleanses from impurity and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">the Spirit transforms hearts</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">So “born of water and the Spirit” signals <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:blue;">a new birth</span> that cleanses and transforms.</span> &mdash; <a href="#btsb_cite">NIV Biblical Theology Study Bible<sup>5</sup></a>

- <a name="esvsb_commentary" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">3.1.2 ESV Study Bible Commentary</a>

    > JOHN—NOTE ON 3:3–6 This discussion of the need for <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">spiritual rebirth</span> further develops the earlier reference to the “children of God” who are “born of God” (1:12–13; cf. 8:39–58; 11:51–52). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">The phrase born of water and the Spirit in 3:5 refers to <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">spiritual birth</span></span>, which cleanses from sin and brings spiritual transformation and renewal. Water here does not refer to the water of physical birth, nor is it likely that it refers to baptism. The background is probably Ezek. 36:25–27, where God promises, “I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean. … And I will give you a new heart. … And I will put my Spirit within you.” For further discussion of being <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">born again</span>, see 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18. The kingdom of God, a major topic in the other Gospels, is mentioned in John only in 3:3, 5 (see the reference to Jesus’ kingdom in John 18:36). &mdash; <a href="#esvsb_cite">ESV Study Bible<sup>1</sup></a>

- <a name="logos_commentary" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">3.1.3 LOGOS Faithlife Study Bible Commentary</a>

    > **3:5 born of water and spirit** Jesus elaborates on the meaning of being born from above in v. 3, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">emphasizing the need for <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:blue;">spiritual birth</span></span> (see note on v. 3). The ot overtones of the Greek phrase used here, literally rendered as “born of water and spirit,” are meant to make Nicodemus realize that Jesus is inaugurating the age of renewal anticipated by the ot prophets (Joel 2:28; Isa 32:15; 44:3; Ezek 11:19–20; 36:25–27). In this regard, Ezek 36:25–27 clearly combines the imagery of cleansing by water with inner renewal by the spirit (pneuma) from God.
    >> Interpretations of this verse often attempt to connect Jesus’ statement with some type of water baptism, understanding references to both physical and spiritual rebirth symbolized by baptism. The phrase “born of water and spirit” could refer to two births, since John 3:6 contrasts being born of the flesh with being born of the Spirit. However, a reference to the Christian sacrament of baptism is unlikely. The mention of water, though, may allude to John’s baptism, which emphasizes repentance from sin. The danger with understanding “born of water” as a reference to water baptism is that it could be misconstrued as making baptism a requirement for salvation. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Any secondary implications about water baptism should be understood as symbolic of spiritual rebirth, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not as a necessary part of salvation</span>.</span> &mdash; <a href="#logos_cite">LOGOS Faithlife Study Bible<sup>4</sup></a>

<a name="mark" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥💧 IV. The Longer Ending Of Mark</a>

It's evident that whether or not the longer ending of mark is a legitimate part of the bible or not, no point of doctrine is affected by the absence or presence of vv. 9–20.<sup><a href="#esvsb_cite">1</a></sup>

- <a name="mss" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">4.1 Missing From Oldest Manuscripts</a>

    > MARK—NOTE ON 16:9–20 “Longer Ending of Mark.” Some ancient manuscripts of Mark’s Gospel contain these verses and others do not, which presents a puzzle for scholars who specialize in the history of such manuscripts. This longer ending is missing from various old and reliable Greek manuscripts (esp. Sinaiticus and Vaticanus), as well as numerous early Latin, Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian manuscripts. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:blue;">Early church fathers</span> (e.g., Origen and Clement of Alexandria) <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:blue;">did not</span> appear to <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:blue;">know of these verses</span>.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">Eusebius and Jerome state that this section is missing in most manuscripts available at their time.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">And some manuscripts that contain vv. 9–20 indicate that older manuscripts lack the section.</span> On the other hand, some early and many later manuscripts (such as the manuscripts known as A, C, and D) contain vv. 9–20, and many church fathers (such as Irenaeus) evidently knew of these verses. As for the verses themselves, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">they contain various Greek words and expressions <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">uncommon to Mark</span>, and there are <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">stylistic differences</span> as well.</span> Many think this shows vv. 9–20 to be a <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">later addition</span>. In summary, vv. 9–20 should be read with caution. As in many translations, the editors of the esv have placed the section within brackets, showing their doubts as to whether it was originally part of what Mark wrote, but also recognizing its long history of acceptance by many in the church. The content of vv. 9–20 is best explained by reference to other passages in the Gospels and the rest of the NT. (Most of its content is found elsewhere, and no point of doctrine is affected by the absence or presence of vv. 9–20.) With particular reference to v. 18, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0099ff;">there is no command to pick up serpents or to drink deadly poison</span>; there is merely a promise of protection as found in other parts of the NT (see Acts 28:3–4; James 5:13–16). (See The Reliability of the New Testament Manuscripts.) &mdash; <a href="#esvsb_cite">ESV Study Bible<sup>1</sup></a>

- <a name="condemned" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">4.2 Never Says We’re Condemned</a>

    > ... whoever does not believe will be condemned.&rdquo; ... The very evident answer to this is simply to say that the verse <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">says nothing about those who believe <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">and are not baptized</span></span>. &mdash; <a href="#grudem">Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster Theological Seminary)<sup>9</sup></a>

<a name="conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">🔥💧 V. Conclusion</a>

It is abundantly clear that 

> While we recognize that Jesus commanded baptism (Matt. 28:19), as did the apostles (Acts 2:38), we should not say that baptism is necessary for salvation. ... To say that baptism or any other action is necessary for salvation is to say that we are not justified by faith alone but by faith plus a certain "work," the work of baptism. The apostle Paul would have opposed the idea... Baptism, then, is not necessary for salvation, But it is necessary if we are to be obedient to Christ, for he commanded baptism for all who believe in him. &mdash; <a href="#grudem">Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster Theological Seminary)<sup>9</sup></a>
