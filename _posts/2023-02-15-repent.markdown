<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;color:Black;">Hello family and friends,</span>

As some of you know I am of the "historic Protestant" position (or sometimes called the "non-Free Grace" position). Justification by faith alone (*Sola fide*) has been a primary belief of Protestants since the time of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation.

![Five Solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg)

This ministry shares this same conviction in the Five solas (Latin *five solae*; Anglicized as *five solas*), which does in fact include, and always has included, Grace alone. 

> “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” &mdash; Aristotle, Metaphysics

The information I am about to disseminate to you is sound so please take heed to what I am about to reveal.



<!-- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;color:Black;">Five Solae</span>

This ministry ardently defends the *five solae* (*Anglicized as five solas*) which were developed by those of the Reformed perspective as a response to heresies found in the Roman Catholic Church.

<!-- > Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith. &mdash; 2Cor. 13:5 [New Living Translation (NLT)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013:5&version=ESV;NET;NLT) -->

<!-- > Put yourselves to the test to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize regarding yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you—unless, indeed, you fail the test! &mdash; 2Cor. 13:5 NET -->

I am writing this article with some hesitation as some of you who read my articles know me personally and hold to the "Free Grace" viewpoint of which I disagree. I would just like to say that I think that we are unified by essential doctrine and I consider you brothers and sisters in Christ.

<!-- In this article I will be arguing for the viewpoint held historically by most influential leaders and statements of faith in historic protestantism. -->

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;color:Black;">Errors Discovered</span>

After some research I have discovered errors within Free Grace theology, which stems from a minority view among the faculty members at Dallas Theological Seminary, more specifically from a man named Zane Hodges who taught from 1959 to 1986. The two topics I would like to cover are as follows:

1. The true meaning of repentance **IS NOT** *"change of mind"* in the NT.
2. Historical *"Justification by faith alone"* differs from the Free Grace Movement.

<!-- In this article I will be arguing for the viewpoint held historically by most influential leaders and statements of faith in historic protestantism. -->

In this article I will be arguing for the view shared by most of the influential leaders and statements of faith in historic protestantism.

<!-- and I am convinced that the theological positions held by this movement is inconsistent with historic protestant convictions. -->

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;color:Black;">Repentance</span>

There are two camps that have developed within the "Free Grace" movement, one believes that repentance means *"a change of mind,"* and the other group says repentance means *"an inward resolve to turn from sin"* which is optional.

> Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately. &mdash; 2Tim. 2:15 NET 

The first is more prominent and the second more reasonable; however, it will soon be evident that this is a false dichotomy.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;color:Black;">Metanoeō and Metanoia</span>

<!-- <sup style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">Metanoeō (μετανοέω)</sup> <sup>[🔊](https://youtu.be/Ql4C5vMOns8)</sup> <sup>and</sup> <sup style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">Metanoia (μετάνοια)</sup> <sup>[🔊](https://youtu.be/3Y-9V38-RCI)</sup> -->

The confusion seems to have begun with a man named Charles Bing who made many false assumptions about the underlying meaning of the greek word <span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">Metanoeō (μετανοέω) [🔊](https://youtu.be/Ql4C5vMOns8)</span>. To demonstrate, he made a footnote to a specialized Greek dictionary, known as a lexicon, which reads *"BAGD, s.v. 'metanoeō,' 513."* to show the meaning *"change of mind."*

<!-- What Bing failed to tell his readers is that *"change of mind."* -->

> What Bing fails to tell his readers is that *"change of mind"* is just the first possible meaning of *metanoeō*, and that the editors of the BAGD lexicon do not put **any** New Testament passages in this first category. Rather, they put **every** New Testament passage under the second meaning, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">"feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense)."</span>
>
They then go on to give many New Testament examples, and they include this statement: "Since in metanoeō the negative impulse of turning away is dominant, it is also used with apo tinos [from something]: **repent and turn away from something** (examples given include repenting from wickedness, from lawlessness, and, with the similar phrase ek tinos, repenting of murders, sorceries, sexual immorality, and thefts)."
>
&mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DDiv, Westminster)

Grudem goes on to reveal, that while Bing misleads his readers to believe that the standard Greek lexicon defines this term as *"change one's mind,"* that is <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">not the meaning this lexicon gives to it for any New Testament examples</span>. 

The true meaning that Bing neglects to mention, involves a much stronger sense that includes feeling remorse, being converted, and turning away from sin, in a religious-ethical sense and in view of responsibility to God.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;color:Black;">No Authoritative Greek Lexicon Or English Bible Agrees With The Free Grace Movement</span>

No authoritative Greek lexicon or English translation of the Bible translates the Greek terms <span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">metanoeō (μετανοέω) [🔊](https://youtu.be/Ql4C5vMOns8)</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">metanoia (μετάνοια) [🔊](https://youtu.be/3Y-9V38-RCI)</span> as <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">"change your mind"</span> for New Testament passages.

> This meaning finds **no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation**... It is a definition unique to Free Grace supporters, **without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference work**. It also lacks support from any English translation of the Bible. &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DD, Westminster)
