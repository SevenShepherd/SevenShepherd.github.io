<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">Hello family and friends,</span>

As some of you know I am of the "historic Protestant" position. <!--(or sometimes called the "non-Free Grace" position).--> Justification by faith alone (*Sola fide*) has been a primary belief of Protestants since the time of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation.

![Five Solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg)

This ministry shares this same conviction in the Five solas (Latin *five solae*; Anglicized as *five solas*), which does in fact include, and **always has included, Grace alone**. 

> ‚ÄúIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.‚Äù &mdash; Aristotle, Metaphysics

The information I am about to disseminate to you is sound so please take heed to what I am about to reveal.

<!-- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">Five Solae</span>

This ministry ardently defends the *five solae* (*Anglicized as five solas*) which were developed by those of the Reformed perspective as a response to heresies found in the Roman Catholic Church.

I am writing this article with some hesitation as some of you who read my articles know me personally and hold to the "Free Grace" viewpoint of which I disagree. I would just like to say that I think that **we are unified by essential doctrine and I consider you brothers and sisters in Christ**.

> Many of the people who hold to the Free Grace viewpoint that I disagree with in the pages that follow have been **my friends for years, even decades.** They strongly affirm the complete inerrancy of the Bible, the Trinity, the full deity of Christ, the substitutionary atonement of Christ for our sins, and dozens upon dozens of other important doctrinal convictions. **Many of them lead exemplary Christian lives. They are genuine brothers and sisters in Christ**... &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DDiv, Westminster Theological Seminary), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). Introduction.

<!-- In this article I will be arguing for the viewpoint held historically by most influential leaders and statements of faith in historic protestantism. -->

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">Errors Discovered</span>

After some research I have discovered errors within Free Grace theology, which stems from a minority view among the faculty members at Dallas Theological Seminary, more specifically from a man named Zane Hodges who taught from 1959 to 1986. The topics I would like to cover are as follows:

1. The true meaning of repentance **IS NOT** *"change of mind"* in the NT.
2. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts.
3. Historical *"Justification by faith alone"* differs from the Free Grace Movement.

<!-- In this article I will be arguing for the viewpoint held historically by most influential leaders and statements of faith in historic protestantism. -->

<!-- > Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?‚Äîunless indeed you fail to meet the test! &mdash; 2Cor. 13:5 ESV -->

> Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you <span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[Or in you.]</span>; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith. &mdash; 2Cor. 13:5 NLT


<!-- and I am convinced that the theological positions held by this movement is inconsistent with historic protestant convictions. -->

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">I. Repentance</span>

There are two camps that have developed within the "Free Grace" movement, one believes that repentance means *"a change of mind,"* and the other group says repentance means *"an inward resolve to turn from sin"* which is optional.

> Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately. &mdash; 2Tim. 2:15 NET 

The first is more prominent and the second more reasonable; however, it will soon be evident that this is a false dichotomy.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">Metanoe≈ç and Metanoia</span>

<!-- <sup style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">Metanoe≈ç (ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒΩŒøŒ≠œâ)</sup> <sup>[üîä](https://youtu.be/Ql4C5vMOns8)</sup> <sup>and</sup> <sup style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">Metanoia (ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±)</sup> <sup>[üîä](https://youtu.be/3Y-9V38-RCI)</sup> -->

The confusion seems to have begun with a man named Charles Bing who made many false assumptions about the underlying meaning of the greek word <span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">Metanoe≈ç (ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒΩŒøŒ≠œâ) [üîä](https://youtu.be/Ql4C5vMOns8)</span>. To demonstrate, he made a footnote to a specialized Greek dictionary, known as a lexicon, which reads *"BAGD, s.v. 'metanoe≈ç,' 513."* to show the meaning *"change of mind."*

<!-- What Bing failed to tell his readers is that *"change of mind."* -->

> What Bing fails to tell his readers is that *"change of mind"* is just the first possible meaning of *metanoe≈ç*, and that the editors of the BAGD lexicon do not put **any** New Testament passages in this first category. Rather, they put **every** New Testament passage under the second meaning, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">"feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense)."</span>
>
They then go on to give many New Testament examples, and they include this statement: "Since in metanoe≈ç the negative impulse of turning away is dominant, it is also used with apo tinos [from something]: **repent and turn away from something** (examples given include repenting from wickedness, from lawlessness, and, with the similar phrase ek tinos, repenting of murders, sorceries, sexual immorality, and thefts)."
>
&mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DDiv, Westminster Theological Seminary), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). p. 57

Grudem goes on to reveal, that while Bing misleads his readers to believe that the standard Greek lexicon defines this term as *"change one's mind,"* that is <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">not the meaning this lexicon gives to it for any New Testament examples</span>. 

The true meaning that Bing neglects to mention, involves a much stronger sense that includes feeling remorse, being converted, and turning away from sin, in a religious-ethical sense and in view of responsibility to God.

<!-- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">No Authoritative Greek Lexicon Or English Bible Agrees With The Free Grace Movement</span> -->

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">A Category Mistake</span>

No authoritative Greek lexicon or English translation of the Bible translates the Greek terms <span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">metanoe≈ç (ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒΩŒøŒ≠œâ) [üîä](https://youtu.be/Ql4C5vMOns8)</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">metanoia (ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±) [üîä](https://youtu.be/3Y-9V38-RCI)</span> as <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">"change your mind"</span> for New Testament passages.

> This meaning finds **no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation**... <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">It is a definition unique to Free Grace supporters</span>, **without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference work**. It also lacks support from any English translation of the Bible. &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DD, Westminster), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). p. 70

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">Definition of Repentance</span>

Repentance takes on the second meaning of: *"feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense)."* in the New Testament. Just as there are multiple meanings for the word *"spirit"* in the dictionary (i.e. the non-physical part of a person; or a distilled beverage) we need to accurately apply the true meaning of Repentance (metanoe≈ç).

> Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ. &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DD, Westminster), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). p. 42

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">II. Faith Is Not Merely An Intellectual Assent To Facts</span>

Knowledge about the facts of Jesus's life, death, burial, and bodily resurrection on it's own is not sufficient for saving faith. Saving faith includes knowledge, approval, and personal trust.

> Of course It is necessary that we have some knowledge of who Christ is and what he has done, for "how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?" (Rom. 10:14). &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DD, Westminster Theological Seminary), [Systematic Theology, 2nd ed.](https://amzn.to/40QF8z5) p. 861

Logically, we already know that there are people that both understand God's laws but simply disagree with them to their own destruction (Romans 1:32). Certainly you don't actually believe they are saved?

<!-- Such is the case in Romans 1:32 where Paul says *"Though they know God‚Äôs righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them."* -->

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus' life and saving works, for James says, "You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe‚Äîand shudder!" (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DD, Westminster Theological Seminary), [Systematic Theology, 2nd ed.](https://amzn.to/40QF8z5) pp. 861-862.

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">III. We're Justified By Faith Alone, But The Faith That Saves Is Never Alone</span>

Saving faith does not include obedience, saving faith results in obedience. If anyone attempts to say that we teach that *"faith includes obedience,"* they are criticizing a straw man.

> We must guard jealously the fact that faith alone is what saves us, not faith plus obedience. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DD, Westminster), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). p. 71

Protestant leaders throughout history have consistently disagreed with the Free Grace position. Genuine saving faith will always be accompanied by good works that come **after** justification.

We have concluded that the "Free Grace" movement is not upholding the Reformation doctrine of *"justification by faith alone"* and does not align with *sola fide*.

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">IV. False Assurance Is Deadly</span>

<!-- Chuck smith  -->

In the 14th verse of the 2nd chapter of the book of James in the Bible, we find that if a person has no good works, and that if there is no change in his life, then that person has a *"dead faith"*&mdash;and verse 14 implies that that kind of faith cannot save a person.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if **someone** says he has faith but does not have works? **Can that faith save him?** <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and filled,‚Äù without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. &mdash; James 2:14-17 ESV

You might be thinking to yourself, how do YOU know that James expects the answer no when he asks the question, *"Can that faith save him?"*. The simple answer is, grammar. 

> <sup>2</sup>The Greek interrogative particle <span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">mƒì</span> at the beginning of the sentence indicates that the author expects a negative answer to the question. &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DDiv, Westminster Theological Seminary), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). pp. 79-80.

Pay attention to the context of whom James is speaking; James is not talking about all of his readers or even most of his readers, he is talking about *"someone"* which is distinguished from *"my brothers."* James continues speaking in context to eternal salvation.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead. &mdash; James 2:20,24,26 ESV

The context shows that James was referring to showing one‚Äôs faith through doing good deeds<sup>[[FSB]](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jas2.24)</sup>. This is not to be confused with Paul (Rom 3:20, 28; Gal 2:16; 3:10‚Äì12) when he was referring to ‚Äúworks‚Äù (erga) of Jewish law.

> ‚ÄúI am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he [takes away](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A1-2&version=NET;EXB;NLT), and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. &mdash; John 15:1-2 ESV

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">Conclusions</span>

When the rich man had died and gone to hell, in torment he begged to warn his brothers, who were still alive, by implying that repentance would save them from hell. Repentance from sin is necessary for saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> And he said, ‚ÄòNo, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will **repent**.‚Äô <sup style="font-weight:bold;">31</sup> He said to him, ‚ÄòIf they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.‚Äô‚Äù &mdash; Luke 16:30-31 ESV

Saving faith does not include obedience, saving faith **results in** obedience. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts. Genuine saving faith will always be accompanied by good works that come **after justification**. Good works and continuing to believe **follow** saving faith (*sola fide*).

> For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed, we will share in all that belongs to Christ. &mdash; Heb. 3:14 NLT

I am reminded of how Chuck Smith once said *"... we are deeply concerned over the words of Jesus in Matthew 7:21-23:"*

> "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
>
**Apparently there are many who claim to be believers that in fact are not.** ... We do believe in perseverance of the saints (true believers), but are deeply concerned about sinful lifestyles and rebellious hearts among those who call themselves "Christians." &mdash; Chuck Smith, [Calvinism, Arminianism, & The Word Of God; Perseverence, p. 13-14](https://amzn.to/3KgwOCz)

We are saved by grace, through faith, not of works [justification], for works [sanctification] (Eph. 2:8-10). Now it is time for you to *"Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God"* (Mt. 3:8 NLT).

> No, I tell you. But unless you ¬∑change your hearts and lives <span style="color:A8A8A8;">[repent]</span>, you will <span style="color:A8A8A8;">[<sup>L</sup>‚ÄØall]</span> be destroyed as they were! &mdash; Luke 13:3 Expanded Bible (EXB)

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">Final Thoughts</span>

This article was written to define repentance and to warn others of what true saving faith looks like, much like the rich man who pleaded to warn his brothers of impending doom. I am often perplexed at how often conviction is confused for judgement. You can only gain by adopting historical Christian perspectives.

> It is inconceivable to me that anyone could... say that... <span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[Free Grace advocates]</span> are preaching a false gospel. That would just be a slanderous and wrongful accusation. &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DDiv, Westminster Theological Seminary), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). pp. 74-75.

I think it's important to state that ***"Free Grace" theology isn't a false gospel***, and it would be slander to say so since they do acknowledge essential doctrine.

> My conclusion... is that **the Free Grace movement preaches a weakened gospel** because it avoids any call to people to repent of their sins. &mdash; Dr. Wyane Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DDiv, Westminster Theological Seminary), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). p. 74.

Keep in mind that Chuck Smith taught for 20 years before "Free Grace" theology was ever systematized, and stressed grace, obedience, holiness, and repentance in the lives of Christians after justification just as this ministry does.
