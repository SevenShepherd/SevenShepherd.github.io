Christianity is a call to discipleship (**Mt 10:38 NLT**; Mt 16:24; **Lk 9:23** Lk 9:62; **Lk 14:27**; Mk 8:34... Jn 15:8 ESV; Mt 3:10; 25:30). ***&ldquo;choose this day whom you will serve&rdquo;*** (Jos 24:15). 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">34</sup> ‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">35</sup> For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">36</sup> And a person's enemies will be those of his own household. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">37</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me</span>, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">38</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.</span> 39 Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. ‚Äî Jesus in Matthew 10:34-40

Will you serve the God of the Bible who taught that repentance is [a turning away from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repent-means-turn/) (Acts 3:26; cf. Ac 3:19) produced by Godly contrition (2Cor 7:10)?

... or will you serve an anti-christ message that cannot be found in scripture? 

- Watered down unscriptural versions of repentance that only takes place in the heads of antinomian heretics?
- False teachings that twist the precious trust and reliance on God called faith into the unrecognizable heresy of assent?
- False teachers lead you into a blind faith, hypocrisy, carnality, debauchery, and eventually destruction through apostasy.

    > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But false prophets arose among the people, just as <span style="font-weight:bold;">there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">even to the point of denying the <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Master</span> who bought them</span>. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">many will follow their <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">[debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles</span></span>. Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. &mdash; [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET)
    >> **The Apostle Peter** reveals that false teachers would infiltrate the church, lead many into [debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles, slandering the way of truth with their destructive heresies. In 2 Peter 2 he describes them as, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">*&ldquo;brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed&rdquo;*</span> (v. 12), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">*&ldquo;springs without water and mists driven by a storm&rdquo;*</span> (v. 17), and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">*&ldquo;slaves of depravity&rdquo;*</span> (v. 19). These statements showcase that the subjects were unregenerate professors of the faith.


I think it is in your best interest to side with [Christ](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/), the [Apostles](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/what-is-a-cult/#Warnings-From-The-Apostles), the scriptures, [the authoritative Greek lexicons and dictionaries](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/#BDAG), the [academic community](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/scholarship-on-repent/), centuries of [sound doctrine, creeds, and confessions](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/sola-fide-the-original-lordship-position/). 

<!-- They despise the truth that repentance is contrition (2Cor 7:10), a hatred for sin (Jude 23 NLT), and a turning from sin (Acts 3:26; Act 3:19). -->

Choose wisely ...
