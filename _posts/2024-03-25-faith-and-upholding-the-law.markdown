## I. Now That We Are Saved By Grace Through Faith We Still Strive To Keep The Moral Law

This is not about legalism, this is about fruit bearing. Even though we are now under grace, this does not mean that we won't bear the fruits of obedience through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (John 15:4).

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Do we then overthrow the law by</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:GoldenRod;">this faith?</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">By no means!</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Crimson;">On the contrary, we uphold the law</span>. &mdash; Romans 3:31 ESV

A Christian who has truly been saved by grace through faith will desire, supernaturally, for Godly dispositions of morality. They will desire to keep the 10 commandments in a non-legalistic, fruit-bearing way. They will progressively desire to do so through the sanctification of the Holy Spirit (2Thess 2:13; Jn 15:1-17; Gal 5:22-23).

## II. Christians Do Not Live Lifestyles Of Indulgent Sin

### We are not under the law, we are under grace, yet we still do not make a practice of sinning

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> What shall we say then? **Are we to remain in sin** so that grace may increase? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> **Absolutely not!** How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> What then? **Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!** &mdash; Romans 6:1-2,15 NET

These verses prove the following three things:
1. We're not under the law (Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. We're under grace (Eph 2:8-10)
3. We still don't make a "practice" of sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31).

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).
