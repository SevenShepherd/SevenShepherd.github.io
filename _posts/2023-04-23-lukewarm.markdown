- <a name="111" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.1.1 Commentary</a>

    When Jesus looked upon Laodicea he used a metaphor to compare it to what it should be. When he said that he wished that they were either cold or hot, he was referring to two water sources. To the east was Colossae<sup><a name="net_notes" href="#net_cite">1</a></sup>, located 10 miles (16 kilometers) from Laodicea<sup><a name="btsb_notes" href="#btsb_cite">4</a></sup>, which had cold, refreshing<sup><a name="logos_notes" href="#logos_cite">3</a></sup>, pure waters, and to the north was the hot springs of Hierapolis, located 6 miles (9.5 kilometers) from Laodicea and were famed for their healing power.<sup><a name="btsb_notes" href="#btsb_cite">4</a></sup>

    By the time these pure sources of water reached Laodicea, which lacked its own water supply<sup><a name="btsb_notes" href="#btsb_cite">4</a></sup>, it was smelly<sup><a name="filament_notes" href="#filament_cite">5</a></sup>, muddy, undrinkable<sup><a name="esvsb_notes" href="#esvsb_cite">0</a></sup> and contaminated<sup><a name="btsb_notes" href="#btsb_cite">4</a></sup>. In like manner, Jesus found his church‚Äôs tepid indifference repugnant<sup><a name="esvsb_notes" href="#esvsb_cite">0</a></sup>, Jesus was saying that the church‚Äôs indecisive commitment to him was revolting.<sup><a name="filament_notes" href="#filament_cite">5</a></sup> Cold water is refreshing; hot water is useful for medical purposes. Lukewarm water is neither. By analogy, the works of the Laodicean church made Christ want to vomit the believers out of His mouth. In very vivid terms, the Lord rejects the halfhearted efforts of self-satisfied Christians.<sup><a name="tnsb_notes" href="#tnsb_cite">6</a></sup>

<!-- 
> The waters of the nearby Lycus River were **muddy and undrinkable**, and the waters flowing by aqueduct from hot springs 5 miles (8 km) away were lukewarm when they reached Laodicea. Likewise, **Jesus found his church‚Äôs tepid indifference repugnant.** Cold and hot water represent something positive, for cold water refreshes in the heat, and hot water is a tonic when one is chilly.
>
> The spiritually blind, bankrupt, naked Laodiceans obviously had no resources to buy from Jesus gold or garments or salve for their eyes. They could ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù these necessities only by his grace, as the Lord had once invited thirsty spiritual paupers to ‚Äúbuy wine and milk without money‚Äù (Isa. 55:1‚Äì4). <sup><a name="esvsb_notes" href="#esvsb_cite">0</a></sup>

> Laodicea was near two other towns, each of which had a unique water source. **To the north was Hierapolis which had a natural hot spring, often used for medicinal purposes. To the east was Colossae which had cold, pure waters.** In contrast to these towns, Laodicea had no permanent supply of good water. Efforts to pipe water to the city from nearby springs were successful, but it would arrive lukewarm. **The metaphor in the text is not meant to relate spiritual fervor to temperature. This would mean that Laodicea would be commended for being spiritually cold, but it is unlikely that Jesus would commend this. Instead, the metaphor condemns Laodicea for not providing spiritual healing (being hot) or spiritual refreshment (being cold) to those around them. It is a condemnation of their lack of works and lack of witness.** <sup><a name="net_notes" href="#net_cite">1</a></sup>

> This imagery may allude to the water system at Laodicea. The city had no water supply of its own; it had cold water piped in from Colossae or hot water piped in from the springs at Hierapolis. When the water arrived in the city, it had become lukewarm. Like the water, the church at Laodicea was neither **refreshing (like cold water)** nor **healing (like hot spring water)**. <sup><a name="logos_notes" href="#logos_cite">3</a></sup>

> **Colossae, located 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Laodicea, had plentiful cold, pure drinking water, while the hot springs of Hierapolis, located 6 miles (9.5 kilometers) north of Laodicea, were famed for their healing power.** Laodicea lacked its own water supply, and its solution was inadequate: water flowing in by aqueduct arrived tepid and contaminated by minerals. Jesus rebukes the complacent church for not offering life or healing to its community. <sup><a name="btsb_notes" href="#btsb_cite">4</a></sup>

> **The hot springs in Hierapolis were famous for their healing qualities. Colosse was equally famous for its cold, refreshing springs. In contrast, the water available in Laodicea was smelly and lukewarm. Such water is distasteful; Jesus was saying that the church's indecisive commitment to him was revolting.** Although Christians in Laodicea felt prosperous and self-sufficient... Jesus accurately saw their wretched and miserable and poor spiritual condition. <sup><a name="filament_notes" href="#filament_cite">5</a></sup>

> Cold water is refreshing; hot water is useful for medical purposes. Lukewarm water is neither. **By analogy, the works of the Laodicean church made Christ want to vomit the believers out of His mouth.** In very vivid terms, **the Lord rejects the halfhearted efforts of self-satisfied Christians.** The Laodicean church was **spiritually self-deluded**. Because the church was wealthy it assumed that it had need of nothing, when in actuality it was **spiritually impoverished**. The church believed that because it had expensive garments it was well-clothed, when it was really **spiritually naked**. It believed that physical sight indicated the ability to see spiritually, when it was actually blind to spiritual realities. Fortunately, Christ provides spiritual gold, heavenly white garments (7:13, 14; 19:7, 8), and healing eye salve to all who repent (v. 19). <sup><a name="tnsb_notes" href="#tnsb_cite">6</a></sup>

<a name="Rom2:24" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.2 Romans 2:24</a>

> For, as it is written, ‚ÄúThe name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.‚Äù &mdash; Romans 2:24 ESV

- <a name="121" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.2.1 Commentary</a>

    As a result of their hypocrisy, the Gentiles themselves blasphemed God.<sup><a name="tnsb_notes" href="#tnsb_cite">6</a></sup> In the same way, as a result of your hypocrisy, the secular world will blaspheme God. You may think, that by partaking in worldly activities with others that you're showing them that you are not "judgemental," but this is a grave error, as your hypocrisy is the very reason they hate God. Do not be conformed to the world (Rom. 12:2), do not give approval to the practices of the lost (Ro 1:32). It is not "judgemental" to speak the truth or walk a correct path. They are judgemental for hating the truth. It is your job not to play the hypocrite and not to condemn yourself in the process (Jd 4 NET).

    > **By your hypocrisy** and crimes **the pagan world is led to despise** a religion which is observed to have no effect in purifying and restraining its professors; and of course the reproach will terminate on the Author of your religion - that is, **the true God**. A life of purity would tend to honor religion and its Author; a life of impurity does the reverse. &mdash; [Barnes' Notes on the Bible](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/romans/2-24.htm)

    <!-- > Because they violated the law, the Jews were exiled by God and were therefore reviled by the Gentiles (Paul adapts phrases from the Septuagint translation of Isa. 52:5; cf. Ezek. 36:20‚Äì23). This dishonored God because they were known as his people. In Paul‚Äôs time their sins did not lead to exile but still led Gentiles to dishonor the God whom the sinful Jews claimed to follow. <sup><a name="esvsb_notes" href="#esvsb_cite">0</a></sup> -->

- <a name="131" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.3.1 Commentary</a>

    Through your good works, the world will see the light of the kingdom, and your Father who is in heaven will be glorified simultaneously.<sup><a name="esvsb_notes" href="#esvsb_cite">0</a></sup> This is similar to 1 Pet. 2:12 in that living a godly life gives convincing testimony of the saving power of God which brings him glory.<sup><a name="mac_notes" href="#mac_cite">mac</a></sup>
