This is a personal blog after all and sometimes I like to talk about my hobbies, like chess or computer programming.

![2605](\assets\images\chess\OneMonth2605.png)

It's been around 20 years or so since I've played Chess. I played for a month or so as a teen and enjoyed it. I learned how to play chess from Bobby Fischer's book &ldquo;*Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess*&rdquo; many years ago. 

I decided to pick it up recently after nearly two decades, and I played about 1841 puzzles this month and managed to reach a puzzle rating of 2605. My rating continues to climb and I expect it to go up a few more hundred points.

Recreational mathematics, logic puzzles, and strategy board games like <a style="color:black;" href="https://youtu.be/cDJXsPS5FPM">Chess</a>, have been shown to increase neuroplasticity. I find the whole game fascinating, and while I've never considered playing professionally, there are many inspirational figures like Fischer that make the game intriguing. 

I may reveal my account and link it here after awhile so you can add me, but for now I'd like to continue working on it in my spare time.

<!-- I would showcase my wins against the Magnus (2882) bot on chess.com, but I don't know that I should count wins by memorization or theory, as the bot was prone to play into certain lines very deeply. Pure tactical skill matters more to me. -->
