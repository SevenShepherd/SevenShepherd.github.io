<!-- ü™Ω -->

The Bible gives a pretty clear message that if we seek we shall find (Mt 7:7-8). Many generations have passed since Christ walked the earth over 20 centuries ago (2000+ years), but the truth has been with us since the very beginning.

> Thus says the Lord:<br>
‚ÄúStand by the roads, and look,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and ask for the ancient paths,<br>
where the good way is; and walk in it,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and find rest for your souls.<br>
But they said, ‚ÄòWe will not walk in it.‚Äô 
>
> &mdash; Jeremiah 6:16 ESV (cf. Deut 32:7)

The Bible supports the notion that the truth can be found in in every generation from the time of Christ. This is why the Bible tells us to inquire of our Grandfathers, the elders before them, and so on, back to the very beginning.

> Remember the days of old;<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>consider the years of many generations;<br>
ask your father, and he will show you,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>your elders, and they will tell you.<br>
> &mdash; Deut 32:7 ESV

# Timeline
