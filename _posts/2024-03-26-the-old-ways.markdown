<!-- ü™Ω -->

The Bible gives a pretty clear message that if we seek we shall find (Mt 7:7-8).

> Thus says the Lord:<br>
‚ÄúStand by the roads, and look,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and ask for the ancient paths,<br>
where the good way is; and walk in it,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and find rest for your souls.<br>
But they said, ‚ÄòWe will not walk in it.‚Äô 
>
> &mdash; Jeremiah 6:16 ESV (cf. Deut 32:7)

Many centuries have passed since Christ walked the earth nearly 2000 years ago, but the truth has been with us since the beginning. We can find this truth in every generation since.

> Remember the days of old;<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>consider the years of many generations;<br>
ask your father, and he will show you,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>your elders, and they will tell you.<br>
> &mdash; Deut 32:7 ESV
