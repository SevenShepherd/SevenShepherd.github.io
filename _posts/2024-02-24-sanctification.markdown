>>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? . . .
And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were
sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by
the Spirit of our God.
1 Corinthians 6:9, 11

**Sanctification, says the Westminster Shorter Catechism (Q.35), is ‘the work of God’s free grace, whereby we are renewed in the whole man after the image of God, and are enabled more and more to die unto sin, and live unto righteousness’.** The concept is not of sin being totally eradicated (that is to
claim too much) or merely counteracted (that is to say too little), but of a
divinely wrought character change freeing us from sinful habits and
forming in us Christlike affections, dispositions, and virtues.
>
Sanctification is an ongoing transformation within a maintained
consecration, and it engenders real righteousness within the frame of
relational holiness. Relational sanctification, the state of being permanently
set apart for God, flows from the cross, where God through Christ
purchased and claimed us for himself (Acts 20:28; 26:18; Heb. 10:10).
Moral renovation, whereby we are increasingly changed from what we once
were, flows from the agency of the indwelling Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:13;
12:1–2; 1 Cor. 6:11, 19–20; 2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 4:22–24; 1 Thess. 5:23; 2
Thess. 2:13; Heb. 13:20–21). God calls his children to sanctity and
graciously gives what he commands (1 Thess. 4:4; 5:23).
>
Regeneration is birth; sanctification is growth. In regeneration, God
implants desires that were not there before: desire for God, for holiness, and
for the hallowing and glorifying of God’s name in this world; desire to pray,
worship, love, serve, honour, and please God; desire to show love and bring
benefit to others. In sanctification, the Holy Spirit ‘works in you to will and
to act’ according to God’s purpose; what he does is prompt you to ‘work
out your salvation’ (i.e. express it in action) by fulfilling these new desires
(Phil. 2:12–13). Christians become increasingly Christlike as the moral
profile of Jesus (the ‘fruit of the Spirit’) is progressively formed in them (2
Cor. 3:18; Gal. 4:19; 5:22–25). Paul’s use of glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18
shows that for him sanctification of character is glorification begun. Then
the physical transformation that gives us a body like Christ’s, one that will
match our totally transformed character and be a perfect means of
expressing it, will be glorification completed (Phil. 3:20–21; 1 Cor. 15:49–
53).
>
Regeneration was a momentary monergistic act of quickening the
spiritually dead. As such, it was God’s work alone. Sanctification, however,
is in one sense synergistic – it is an ongoing cooperative process in which
regenerate persons, alive to God and freed from sin’s dominion (Rom. 6:11,
14–18), are required to exert themselves in sustained obedience. God’s
method of sanctification is neither activism (self-reliant activity) nor apathy
(God-reliant passivity), but God-dependent effort (2 Cor. 7:1; Phil. 3:10–14;
Heb. 12:14). Knowing that without Christ’s enabling we can do nothing,
morally speaking, as we should, and that he is ready to strengthen us for all
that we have to do (Phil. 4:13), we ‘stay put’ (remain, abide) in Christ,
asking for his help constantly – and we receive it (Col. 1:11; 1 Tim. 1:12; 2
Tim. 1:7; 2:1).
>
The standard to which God’s work of sanctifying his saints is directed is
his own revealed moral law, as expounded and modelled by Christ himself.
Christ’s love, humility, and patience under pressure are to be consciously
imitated (Eph. 5:2; Phil. 2:5–11; 1 Pet. 2:21), for a Christlike spirit and
attitude are part of what law-keeping involves.
>
Believers find within themselves contrary urgings. The Spirit sustains
their regenerate desires and purposes; their fallen, Adamic instincts (the
‘flesh’) which, though dethroned, are not yet destroyed, constantly distract
them from doing God’s will and allure them along paths that lead to death
(Gal. 5:16–17; Jas. 1:14–15). To clarify the relationship between the law
and sin, Paul analyses in a personal and dramatic way the sense of
impotence for complete law-keeping, and the enslavement to behaviour one
dislikes, that the Spirit–flesh tension produces (Rom. 7:14–25). This
conflict and frustration will be with Christians as long as they are in the
body. Yet by watching and praying against temptation, and cultivating
opposite virtues, they may through the Spirit’s help ‘mortify’ (i.e. drain the
life out of, weaken as a means of killing) particular bad habits, and in that
sense more and more die to sin (Rom. 8:13; Col. 3:5). They will experience
many particular deliverances and victories in their unending battle with sin,
while never being exposed to temptations that are impossible to resist (1
Cor. 10:13).

<a name="grudem-on-sanctification" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.2 Differences Between Justification and Sanctification</a>

> The following table specifies several differences between justification and sanctification:
>
|Justification|Sanctification|
|:-:|:-:|
|Legal standing|Internal condition|
|Once for all time|Continuous throughout life|
|Entirely God’s work|We cooperate|
|Perfect in this life|Not perfect in this life|
|The same in all Christians|Greater in some than in others|
>
As this chart indicates, sanctification is something that continues throughout our Christian life. The ordinary course of a Christian’s life will involve continual growth in sanctification, and it is something that the New Testament encourages us to give effort and attention to.
