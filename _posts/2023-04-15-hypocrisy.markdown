> Ask God to reveal the hypocrisy in your life&mdash;an inconsistency between what you profess and what you practice. Then ask God to bring you so close to Christ that you won't have any desire to live an inconsistent, deceitful life. &mdash; Billy Graham

    Commentary from Thomas Nelson Study Bibles reveals that <span style="font-style:italic;color:#828282;">"7:6, 7 Jesus did not directly answer the question but instead addressed two more significant issues: <span style="font-weight:bold;">(1) the superiority of God‚Äôs law over man-made tradition (vv. Mark 7:6-13)</span> and (2) the difference between ceremonial and true moral defilement (vv. Mark 7:14-23). Jesus enters into the argument by calling His adversaries hypocrites. **The term originally referred to actors who wore masks on stage as they played different characters.** Thus the Pharisees were not genuinely religious; they were merely playing a part for all to see"</span>

Carson (Ph.D., Cambridge)</a> writes <span style="font-style:italic;color:#828282;"> "7:6‚Äì8 For the first time, Jesus publicly denounces Jerusalem‚Äôs teachers. Previous critics from Jerusalem had blasphemed the Holy Spirit, making God their enemy (see note on mk 3:29). While these teachers of the law (see note on mk 1:22) see marketplaces as a source of impurity (v. 4)‚Äîthough they love the praise garnered there (mk 12:38)‚ÄîJesus, the true Shepherd-King (see note on mk 6:34), sees marketplaces as places to bring God‚Äôs promised restoration to his people (mk 6:56). Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. Israel was already under God‚Äôs judgment for its idolatrous disobedience (Isa 6:9‚Äì10; see notes on mk 4:12; 8:16‚Äì21), and Isaiah had already denounced Israel‚Äôs faithless and blind leaders (Isa 29:9‚Äì10) for pretending to worship God while they pursued their own agendas (Isa 29:13, the text Jesus cites here). For Jesus, Jerusalem‚Äôs present leaders are in exactly the same position (see note on mk 3:29). <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Pharisees and teachers of the law are ‚Äúhypocrites‚Äù because by requiring people in general to do what God himself had only required of the priests in their temple service, they had put their merely human tradition above the revealed word of God in the Scriptures.</span> Only those whose ‚Äúhearts are far from [God]‚Äù (v. 6) would presume to do such a thing."</span>

    John MacArthur writes <span style="font-style:italic;color:#828282;">"7:6 did Isaiah prophesy. Isaiah 29:13 is quoted almost word for word from the Greek translation of the OT (LXX). Isaiah‚Äôs prophecy perfectly fit the actions of the Pharisees and scribes (see note on Isa. 29:13). hypocrites. Spiritual phonies (see note on Matt. 6:2). <span style="font-weight:bold;">They followed the traditions of men because such teaching required only mechanical and thoughtless conformity without a pure heart.</span>"</span>
