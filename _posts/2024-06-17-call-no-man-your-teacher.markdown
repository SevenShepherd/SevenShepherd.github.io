<!-- Once you realize as I have, that every man-made system has failed, you will begin to understand that you have been lied to by charlatans posing as shepherds. -->

After observing the failure of every man-made system, I realized that systematic theologians are not necessary if you understand how to study the Bible yourself. However, we do need [biblical language scholars](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/) to provide us with English translations and lexicons, as our manuscripts are in Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek, not our native tongue. Beyond this, the Bible tells us that **we have only one teacher, Christ Jesus**. So, the next time someone sends you videos from a questionable systematic theologian attempting to indoctrinate you into one of the *'isms*, remember that theologians are not meant to interpret scripture for you—that right belongs to the Holy Spirit (1Jn 2:27; Jn 14:26;16:13; 2Pe 1:20-21; 1 Cor 2:12-14). Instead, open your Bible and see for yourself.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">8</sup> “Don’t let anyone call you ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one teacher, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters. <sup style="font-weight:bold">9</sup> And don’t address anyone here on earth as ‘Father,’ for only God in heaven is your Father. &mdash; Matthew 23:8-9

Pastors & shepherds (Mt 28:19-20; Mk 16:15) have been infinitely more accurate and necessary than any systematic theologian (1 Cor 1:20-21). All we need is to read the Bible and to preach what it says, not to push our man-made theologies that have time and time again destroyed and divided the body of Christ away from scripture.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">20</sup> So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world’s brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. <sup style="font-weight:bold">21</sup> Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe. &mdash; 1 Cor 1:20-21

<!-- I recommend an accurate Bible that is closest to the original autograph, like ESV Study Bible (literal), NET Full Notes (optimal), NLT Filament (dynamic & meaning based). I then recommend The English-Greek Reverse Interlinear New Testament: English Standard Version (ESV) and the lexicon like BDAG, the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon to understand the meaning of the Greek words in the new testament, and HALOT to understand biblical hebrew in the old testament. -->

Get rid of systematic theologians and those who attempt to interpret scripture for you and replace them with materials produced from [biblical language scholars](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/) & textual critics. This will bring you closest to God's word.
- BDAG & HALOT Lexicons (word study)
    - The world's most authoritative lexicons
- ESV Reverse Interlinear (word study)
- NET Full Notes (optimal)
    - World’s foremost biblical scholars
    - Non-sectarian and inter-denominational
    - Notes are an unparalleled treasure trove of textual criticism
    - My personal favorite (with the full notes only)

**You don't need systematic theologians or theologies. You just need the Bible and the Holy Spirit.** Systematic theology was a bad phase of a bygone era. Lexicons and textual criticism are all you need to bridge the language gap, and Christ is your only teacher. The world can **never** know God through human wisdom. Systematic Theologies that push specific *'isms* (Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), etc.) should be synonymous with indoctrination in this advanced day and age.
