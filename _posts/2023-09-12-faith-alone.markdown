This distortion has to do with the removal of the second half of the definition. I think it should be obvious, that if someone were to tamper with the reformation doctrine of "faith alone," that it would destabilize the soundness of the doctrine.

## I. Not The &ldquo;*Faith Alone*&rdquo; Of The Reformation

The second half of the sentence, &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***,&rdquo; means that other things always accompany saving faith. Namely, saving faith is always followed by changes in a person's conduct of life. That is to say, saving faith is never alone in a person, for *some good works will always accompany saving faith in a person's life* and will be seen after a person comes to faith.

While the Reformers always took &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; to mean that faith is the only thing that God responds to, historic protestant teaching has never taken &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;*faith that occurs by itself* in a person, unaccompanied by other human activities&rdquo;

## III. Consequences

# The difference between sound doctrine and heresy

Understanding James 2:24 is the difference between having sound doctrine, being legalist, or being antinomian. The second half of &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***&rdquo; protected us from antinomianism. While the first half protected us from legalism.

<!-- 1. (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) -->

## IV. Conclusion

After reading the consistent testimony from all major traditions that came from the Reformation&mdash;Lutheran, Reformed or Presbyterian, Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, and Pentecostal&mdash;we should start to wonder why there has been a departure from their sound teaching.

As you can see, plain as day, none of them ever taught that &ldquo;*justification by faith alone*&rdquo; means &ldquo;*faith not accompanied by repentance or by good works.*&rdquo; In the historic protestant theological tradition, &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; has never meant &ldquo;*faith not accompanied by other human actions.*&rdquo; Rather, &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; has always meant that &ldquo;*faith is the only thing that God responds to with the act of justification.*&rdquo;

The Reformers are the biggest group to come out against legalism in the history of Christianity, even to this day. Which should make this ordeal that much more profound, when you hear false teachers twist the minds of the naive against the sound doctrines of the reformation. They died defending sola fide from legalists, and now, here I am defending it from antinomians.

If anyone says to you that &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone*&rdquo; is contradictory, that person is not logical whatsoever. Not only are they incapable of logic, but they also have a feeble understanding of the English language.

There are two different verbs in the two halves of the sentence, which makes it clear that &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; in the first half of the expression is functioning in a different way from &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; in the second half. In the first half &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; modifies &ldquo;*justified,*&rdquo; and in the second half it modifies &ldquo;*is.*&rdquo;

When false teachers remove parts of the full definition, they create their own contradictions. It's also worth noting, something that results from something else, or follows after it, cannot contribute to it.

This is one of those articles where I feel like im talking to a child about the order of the alphabet or how 1 + 2 = 3. You can't tell me you guys don't see how absurd these attacks are.

I think it should be clear that if your theology cannot reconcile Eph 2:8-10 with James 2:14-26; 1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10, it is a bad theology and it should be thrown out with the garbage of bad ideas. The Bible must work together, as there are no contradictions in the word of God.

The Reformers were right. Justification is by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified.
