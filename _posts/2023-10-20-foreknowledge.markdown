## My Unique Theory On Foreknowledge

Like the [reformed theologians](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis/#demarest) and [lexicons suggest](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis/#studies), it's not about knowing facts about whether someone will come to faith, as no relationship exists or lasts based on knowledge alone, but it is instead a more profound &ldquo;foreloving&rdquo;, as Demarest alludes:

> ... &ldquo;With God as subject the verb could mean either prescience or foreloving/foreordaining (Rom 8:29; 11:2; 1 Pet 1:20)... 
>
... the probable meaning of proginōskō with God as subject is to “know intimately” or “forelove.”... 
>
... The NT frequently cites the very close relationship that exists between God’s loving and his choosing (Eph 1:4; Col 3:12; 1 Thess 1:4; 2 Thess 2:13).&rdquo;...
>
&mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest (Ph.D., University of Manchester), Chapter Three, The Doctrine of Election. pp. 127-131.

The only thing that I would alter is that this foreloving is reciprocal, not in the way of facts of forseen faith, or human free will like in Arminianism, but instead something much more profound and deeper than the one-sided arbitrary choice of Calvinist theology. Not "knowledge of facts" but instead a forefelt "foreloving" of reciprocated love irrespective of time. It describes the deeper inexplicable and enigmatic ways of reciprocal love that has always defied logic, reason, facts, choice, will or decision.

A forelove, deep, transcendant, intimate, and reciprocal, beyond the spatiotemporal limitations of human understanding or free decision. Neither by arbitrary or random selection (cal.), nor by facts of forseen faith (arm.), but a deeper foreloveing by the heart he did foreknow.

- Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ? 
- How many of you chose your wives or husbands without reciprocation?
- When has love ever been a choice?
- When you're in love, you "just know," it's not about free will or decision.
- This reciprocation was never a logical decision was it.
- How could something heartfelt (primary) be a human decision (secondary).
- We were made in the image of God but both sides are stuck on the brain and not the heart or reciprocal love that transcends time.
- What could be more love based than trust and reliance resulting in obedience (saving faith)?

This is a theory still under development. I feel as though if it were joined with hypothetical universalism or amyraldism, that it would reach a maximal theology.
