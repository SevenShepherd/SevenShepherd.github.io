<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Doulos ∴</div>

The Greek word for slaves is <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">δοῦλος</span> ([doulos](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1401/mgnt/tr/0-1/)), and is pronounced [🔊 doo'-los](https://youtu.be/MKFLawatxlY). In a spiritual sense, the connotation of the word slaves in this context is one who has ***voluntarily*** sold himself into slavery to Jesus Christ. A good translation is the word “bondservant”, in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another.

The New Testament uses doulos to describe an individual who is totally subordinate to a master (cf. Mt 8:9; 24:46; 2Pe 2:19) and even owned by that master (Phile 1:16-19). Jesus is our Lord and master (2Co 4:5), and we are His slaves (Ro 1:1; Ph 1:1). 

The word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. This underscores His great redemption in buying believers from slavery to sin (Ro 6:16, 1 Co 6:20; 7:23). This also underscores the believer’s absolute surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ (Ro 6:16-17).

<!-- tn Grk “slaves.” Although this translation frequently renders δοῦλος (doulos) as “slave,” the connotation is often of one who has sold himself into slavery; in a spiritual sense, the idea is that of becoming a slave of God or of Jesus Christ voluntarily. The voluntary notion is conspicuous here; hence, the translation “servants.” In any case, the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that “‘servant’ for ‘slave’ is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times…in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished” (BDAG 260 s.v.). A good translation is “bondservant” (sometimes found in the ASV for δοῦλος), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force. -->

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Apokalypsis ∴</div>

The term &#8220;*Revelation*&#8221; comes from the Greek word <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">Ἀποκάλυψις</span> ([Apokalypsis](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g602/mgnt/tr/0-1/), sometimes transliterated as [*apokalupsis*](https://biblehub.com/greek/602.htm)), and is pronounced [🔊 ap-ok-al'-oop-sis](https://youtu.be/ohNVe34B_BM). It means <span style="font-style:Italic;color:#00802b;">“Unveiling”</span> or <span style="font-style:Italic;color:#00802b;">“Disclosure”</span> and can often be found in the epistles (Ro 2:5; 8:19; 1Co 1:7; 2Th 1:7; 1Pe 1:7,13; 4:13; Lk 2:32).

<!-- The KJV has a myriad of ways it likes to translate the same word in the epistles, examples such as a *"manifestation"* in Romans 8:19, a *coming* in 1 Cor. 1:7, a *"revealing"* 2 Thes. 1:7, and an *"appearing"* in 1 Pet. 1:7. Modern translations that use much older underlying manuscripts are much more consistent, you can see this consistency by clicking the verses above translated in the superior ESV. -->

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Commentary ∴</div>

<!-- The Book of Revelation, then, concerns the unveiling or appearing of our precious Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. It is not the unfolding of the story of St. John the Divine, or even of prophetical truth, but rather the message of the “appearing of Christ.” This appearing takes place at the Rapture in Re 4:1, as well as at the hour of His return to the earth when every eye shall see Him Re 1:7. -->

With our newfound understanding of the underlying meaning of the word Revelation, we can conclude that The Book of Revelation is about the unveiling of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ (2Pe 1:1; Tit 2:13). This unveiling takes place at the rapture (Re 4:1), as well as at the hour of His return to the earth when every eye shall see Him (Re 1:7).

Jesus is simultaneously the One revealed and the Revealer. God The Father gives this Revelation (the unveiled truth) to Jesus (Mt 11:27; Re 5:7). This truth was then sent by Jesus to John (Re 10:9) through His angel to show His slaves in the Churches what will happen soon (Re 1:1), because the time is near (Re 1:3). This certainly pictures the present hour when signs pointing to Jesus' return are beginning to appear with alarming frequency. 

The Book of Revelation is a study of signs. From the sign of the Holy Spirit presented as seven spirits (Re 1:4), to the sign of the seven golden lampstands and the seven stars (Re 1:20). Thus, through signs, we come to an understanding of this gloriously revealed portion of Scripture. 

In the epilogue, John, unlike Daniel, is told not to seal his prophecy (Re 22:10; cf. Dan. 12:4). John’s visions are important for his first-century readers as well as for later generations of believers.

<!-- Secondly, we see that this revelation was given to Jesus Christ, as is everything, for Jesus said, *All things are delivered unto me of my Father* Mt 11:27. They are presented unto Him to *shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass.* The term *shortly* in the original means *"rapidity of action once there is a beginning."* This certainly pictures the present hour when signs pointing to His return are beginning to appear with alarming frequency. These truths, then, are sent and signified by Christ's angel unto John, the writer of the book, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Notice that the four letters of the word *signified* spell SIGN. Why? The Book of Revelation is a study of signs. There is the sign of the Holy Spirit presented as seven spirits Re 1:4 and the sign of the seven golden candlesticks and the seven stars in Re 1:20. Thus, through signs, we come to an understanding of this gloriously revealed portion of Scripture. -->

<!-- NOTE ON 1:1 revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus is both the One revealed (referred to variously as Son of Man, Lion of Judah, Lamb, Word of God) and the Revealer. God transmits the unveiled truth to Jesus (Re 5:7), and his angel conveys it to John (Re 10:9) for God’s servants in the churches. The prophecy must … take place because it is secured by God’s sovereign purpose and power. It will take place soon, because “the time is near” (Re 1:3). In the epilogue, John, unlike Daniel, is told not to seal his prophecy (Re 22:10; cf. Dan. 12:4). John’s visions are important for his first-century readers as well as for later generations of believers. -->

</blockquote>

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Makarios ∴</div>

The Greek word for Blessed is <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">μακάριος</span> ([makarios](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3107/lsb/mgnt/0-1/)), and is pronounced [🔊 mak-ar'-ee-os](https://youtu.be/QOIbiTKYyu4). This word can alternately be translated as [happy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A3&version=EXB;MOUNCE). 

This is the first of seven blessings which are given to those who read or hear, as well as obey God’s Word. The remaining six blessings can be found in Rev. 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7, 14.

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Commentary ∴</div>

Verse three demonstrates that the apocalypse is not some impossible to understand, esoteric book. In fact this verse proves the complete opposite. God is giving blessings to those who read, hear, and obey. If people were unable to comprehend what was written, there would be no one who could read or hear this book.

<!-- Revelation is understandable and fills the heart with joy once one sees its glorious message concerning the Saviour. -->

<span style="font-size:19px;">Jesus Imminent Return</span>

When the bible says that **the time is *near***, or that it is ***at hand***, this is telling us that the Return of Christ is imminent. Christ's return is the next event on Father God's calender and could happen at anytime. It could happen right now while I type this commentary, or in a few days from now when you're reading it, or decades from now, etc. 

The Bible teaches us that only the Father in heaven knows the day and hour, not even the Son, or His angels (Mt 24:36). We are instructed to be alert and disciplined unto prayer, because the end of all things is at hand (1Pe 4:7 ESV). The Bible warns us that the day of the Lord will come suddenly, like a thief in the night! (1Th 5:2–4; 2Pe 3:10) 

This fast approaching time is compared to the dawn of a new day, from a night that is almost gone (Ro 13:12). Christians should fix their gaze heavenwards, as a crown of righteousness awaits those of us who watch for our God's return (Tit 2:13; 2Tim 4:8).

<span style="font-size:19px;">Conduct of a True Christian</span>

Because the ***Lord is near***, it is important that we let others observe our conduct as gentle, kind, considerate, and patient (Ph 4:5). This is how we prove that we are truly of God (Mt 3:8 NLT), and that it wasn't just lip service (James 1:22 NLT; Is 29:13 NLT; Mt 15:8 NLT) when you asked God into your heart. The Bible teaches that you will be able to identify a true Christian by their fruit, that is by the way that they act (Mt 7:16 NLT). 

If a Christian's life is devoid of the fruit of the spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal 5:19-21), these people have fooled themselves into believing that they are Christians (James 1:22 NLT). Remember that it is only those who do the will of the Father that will enter Heaven (Mt 7:21).

No one who makes a ***practice*** of sin is a true Christian (1Jn 3:9 ESV), they will not make it to Heaven (Gal 5:19-21) because they've chosen to be children of the devil (1Jn 3:10 ESV). Every person who does not produce good fruit will be cut down and cast into fire (Mt 3:10 NLT).

<span style="font-size:19px;">Teach with Kindness & Patience</span>

Make sure you're ready for the rapture & revelation. This includes being able to teach with patience and kindness. Remember that when we see people setting dates for Christ's Return, or find someone who is Christian in name only:

- Speaking negatively about others (Pr 11:12 NLT; Mt 5:22 ESV; Lk 6:45 NLT).
- Gossiping about others (Pr 16:28 NLT).
- Slandering other people in the congregation (James 4:11-12; Pr 10:18 ESV; 20:19; 1Pe 2:1; Ps 101:5 ESV).
- Bringing false witness (Pr 6:16-19).
- Hating, hatred is equivalent to murder (1Jn 3:15; Pr 11:9 NLT; 1Jn 2:9 NLT; 1Jn 4:20 NLT).
- Sleeping around, or doing [drugs](https://www.gotquestions.org/pharmakeia-in-the-Bible.html) (Re 21:8; Gal 5:19-21)
- Speaking profanities (James 1:26)
- Demonstrating other works of the flesh. 

Teach them lovingly with kindness, and patience (2Tim 2:24 NLT; 1Jn 4:7-8,11-12; Gal 5:14; Jn 15:12; Ph 2:3; Heb 13:1-2 NET). If you find that they are inconsolable, consider these verses (Tit 3:10 NLT; 2Ti 3:1-5 ESV; 2Th 2:3)

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Commentary ∴</div>



<span style="font-size:19px;">The Seven Churches</span>

John now focuses his attention on seven local churches.<sup>[JVI]</sup> Seven symbolizes completeness (God's number of perfection) and implies that Christ addresses the whole church through these seven churches.<sup>[ESVSB]</sup> The number also pictures seven different sets of conditions reflecting the history of God's people through the church age.<sup>[JVI]</sup> Asia was a Roman province in what is now part of western Turkey,<sup>[[EXB/NLT]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=EXB;NLT)</sup> and is not referring to the continent of Asia.<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=NET)</sup>

The Roman province of Asia made up about one-third of modern Asia Minor and was on the western side. Asia is situated to the west of the region of Phrygia and Galatia.<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=NET)</sup>

<span style="font-size:19px;">Grace To You And Peace</span>

God's salutation, found in 19/27 books in the NT is presented in this verse as well: *Grace be unto you and peace*, as the KJV puts it. Notice how *Grace* comes before *peace*, this is the order God shows his unmerited favor. Sinners cannot have peace without first receiving grace. This grace was shown at Calvary and is freely bestowed upon all who believe and receive Christ (Ep 2:8-9; Tit 2:11; Rom 5:1; Col 1:20; Rom 15:13).<sup>[JVI]</sup>

<!-- We also find that the message of grace and peace is from the entire Trinity.  -->

John’s greeting (the message of grace and peace) comes “from” all three persons of the Trinity.<sup>[ESVSB]</sup> First, the Father who is, and who was, and who is to come; then from the seven Spirits which are before the throne (a designation of the blessed Holy Spirit in all of His holiness, for seven means perfection).<sup>[JVI]</sup>

<span style="font-size:19px;">The One Who Is And Who Was And Who Is To Come</span>

These three descriptions function like titles for God; Ex. 3:14–15.<sup>[[EXB]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=EXB)</sup>

The passage appears to be an allusion to Exod 3:14 (in the LXX) where God refers to himself as “he who is” (ὁ ὤν), the same wording in Greek as here in Rev 1:4. Thus, it appears that John is wanting to leave the divine name untouched (perhaps to allude to God’s immutability, or as a pointer to the Old Testament as the key to unlocking the meaning of this book), irrespective of what it “looks” like grammatically.<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=NET)</sup> 

<!-- The translation has placed the “he who is” in quotation marks to indicate to the reader that the syntactical awkwardness is intentional. (For further comments, see ExSyn 63).  -->

BDAG (A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament) 106 s.v. ἀπό 5.d states: “The expr. εἰρήνη ἀπὸ ‘ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος’ Rv 1:4 is quite extraordinary. It may be an interpretation of the name Yahweh already current, or an attempt to show reverence for the divine name by preserving it unchanged, or simply one more of the grammatical peculiarities so frequent in Rv.”<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=NET)</sup>

This is referring either to angels or to the “sevenfold Spirit”—the Holy Spirit portrayed in his perfection (the number seven indicating completeness).<sup>[[EXB]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=EXB)</sup>

The Holy Spirit is presented as one person in Revelation (Re 3:6, 13; cf. Eph. 4:4), but that he also appears as “seven spirits” (cf. Rev. 3:1; 4:5) which represent perfection, and as “seven torches of fire” (Re 4:5) and “seven eyes” (Re 5:6) to express his omnipresence and omniscience.<sup>[ESVSB]</sup>

<span style="font-size:19px;">The Faithful Witness</span> 

In much the same way that Jesus was the faithful witness even unto death (1Ti 6:13), Christians are called to be faithful witnesses as well (Re 2:13; 12:11; 20:4).<sup>[ESVSB]</sup> The Greek term translated witness can mean both “witness” and “martyr.”<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A5&version=NET)</sup> Jesus is “the” quintessential faithful witness.

<span style="font-size:19px;">The Firstborn Of The Dead, And The Ruler Of The Kings Of The Earth.</span> 

The firstborn of the dead, means Jesus has overcome or triumphed over death itself and that he is sovereign over all earthly powers (cf. Re 19:16). This fact was meant to comfort John's persecuted readers.<sup>[ESVSB]</sup>
