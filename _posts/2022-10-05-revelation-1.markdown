<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">‚à¥ Slave ‚à¥</div>

The Greek word for slaves is <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ</span> (doulos) which refers to the individuals who serve under the authority of another. The New Testament uses doulos to describe an individual who is totally subordinate to a master (cf. Mt 8:9; 24:46; 2Pe 2:19) and even owned by that master (Phile 1:16-19). 

The connotation in this context is one who has voluntarily sold himself into slavery to Jesus Christ, in a spiritual sense. The word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. A good translation is ‚Äúbondservant‚Äù, in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another.

Jesus is our Lord and master (2Co 4:5), and we are His slaves (Ro 1:1; Ph 1:1). This underscores His great redemption in buying believers from slavery to sin (Ro 6:16). This also underscores the believer‚Äôs absolute surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ (Ro 6:16-17).

<!-- tn Grk ‚Äúslaves.‚Äù Although this translation frequently renders Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ (doulos) as ‚Äúslave,‚Äù the connotation is often of one who has sold himself into slavery; in a spiritual sense, the idea is that of becoming a slave of God or of Jesus Christ voluntarily. The voluntary notion is conspicuous here; hence, the translation ‚Äúservants.‚Äù In any case, the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that ‚Äú‚Äòservant‚Äô for ‚Äòslave‚Äô is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times‚Ä¶in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished‚Äù (BDAG 260 s.v.). A good translation is ‚Äúbondservant‚Äù (sometimes found in the ASV for Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force. -->

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">‚à¥ Revelation ‚à¥</div>

The term &#8220;*Revelation*&#8221; comes from the Greek word <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">·ºàœÄŒøŒ∫Œ¨ŒªœÖœàŒπœÇ</span>, which means <span style="font-style:Italic;color:#00802b;">‚ÄúUnveiling‚Äù</span> or <span style="font-style:Italic;color:#00802b;">‚ÄúDisclosure‚Äù</span> and can often be found in the epistles (Ro 8:19; 1Co 1:7; 2Th 1:7; 1Pe 1:7). The transliteration [***Apokalypsis***](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g602/mgnt/tr/0-1/) (sometimes [*apokalupsis*](https://biblehub.com/greek/602.htm)), pronounced [üîä ap-ok-al'-oop-sis](https://youtu.be/ohNVe34B_BM), is taken from the following sources:

<!-- The KJV has a myriad of ways it likes to translate the same word in the epistles, examples such as a *"manifestation"* in Romans 8:19, a *coming* in 1 Cor. 1:7, a *"revealing"* 2 Thes. 1:7, and an *"appearing"* in 1 Pet. 1:7. Modern translations that use much older underlying manuscripts are much more consistent, you can see this consistency by clicking the verses above translated in the superior ESV. -->

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">‚à¥ Commentary ‚à¥</div>

<!-- The Book of Revelation, then, concerns the unveiling or appearing of our precious Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. It is not the unfolding of the story of St. John the Divine, or even of prophetical truth, but rather the message of the ‚Äúappearing of Christ.‚Äù This appearing takes place at the Rapture in Re 4:1, as well as at the hour of His return to the earth when every eye shall see Him Re 1:7. -->

With our newfound understanding of the underlying meaning of the word Revelation, we can conclude that The Book of Revelation is about the unveiling of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ (2Pe 1:1; Tit 2:13). This unveiling takes place at the rapture (Re 4:1), as well as at the hour of His return to the earth when every eye shall see Him (Re 1:7).

Jesus is simultaneously the One revealed and the Revealer. God The Father gives this Revelation (the unveiled truth) to Jesus (Mt 11:27; Re 5:7). This truth was then sent by Jesus to John (Re 10:9) through His angel to show His slaves in the Churches what will happen soon (Re 1:1), because the time is near (Re 1:3). This certainly pictures the present hour when signs pointing to Jesus' return are beginning to appear with alarming frequency. 

The Book of Revelation is a study of signs. From the sign of the Holy Spirit presented as seven spirits Re 1:4, to the sign of the seven golden lampstands and the seven stars in Re 1:20. Thus, through signs, we come to an understanding of this gloriously revealed portion of Scripture. In the epilogue, John, unlike Daniel, is told not to seal his prophecy (Re 22:10; cf. Dan. 12:4). John‚Äôs visions are important for his first-century readers as well as for later generations of believers.

<!-- Secondly, we see that this revelation was given to Jesus Christ, as is everything, for Jesus said, *All things are delivered unto me of my Father* Mt 11:27. They are presented unto Him to *shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass.* The term *shortly* in the original means *"rapidity of action once there is a beginning."* This certainly pictures the present hour when signs pointing to His return are beginning to appear with alarming frequency. These truths, then, are sent and signified by Christ's angel unto John, the writer of the book, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Notice that the four letters of the word *signified* spell SIGN. Why? The Book of Revelation is a study of signs. There is the sign of the Holy Spirit presented as seven spirits Re 1:4 and the sign of the seven golden candlesticks and the seven stars in Re 1:20. Thus, through signs, we come to an understanding of this gloriously revealed portion of Scripture. -->

<!-- NOTE ON 1:1 revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus is both the One revealed (referred to variously as Son of Man, Lion of Judah, Lamb, Word of God) and the Revealer. God transmits the unveiled truth to Jesus (Re 5:7), and his angel conveys it to John (Re 10:9) for God‚Äôs servants in the churches. The prophecy must ‚Ä¶ take place because it is secured by God‚Äôs sovereign purpose and power. It will take place soon, because ‚Äúthe time is near‚Äù (Re 1:3). In the epilogue, John, unlike Daniel, is told not to seal his prophecy (Re 22:10; cf. Dan. 12:4). John‚Äôs visions are important for his first-century readers as well as for later generations of believers. -->
