<!-- Zero Reasons Why You Should Believe Dispensationalism -->

<!-- Things You Probably Didn't Know About Dispensationalism (Revised) -->

<!-- ‚Äú140 years ago, when a 15 year old girl had a revelation, and that revelation was picked up by J. N. Darby, the founder of the Plymouth Brethren, and developed into a form of theology known as dispensational theology‚Äù ‚Äî Dr. Walter Martin... Now That Is Strange Fire." -->

<!-- <sup>‚ö†Ô∏è Under Construction. Refresh weekly for updates.</sup> -->

Growing up, dispensationalism was probably one of my favorite eschatological systems, but over the years, and the more I study it, the more pronounced it's flaws seem to be (Ecc 1:18). If I absolutely had to change systems, I'd probably look into Historic Premillennialism, a system held by [Dr. Walter Martin (Ph.D., California Coast University)](https://youtu.be/uO0TAHKzPFw?si=qbF7x_gk18zTGVht), and [Dr. D.A. Carson (Ph.D., University of Cambridge)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L87oCIFEsnE&list=PLwPFJqrolLPQ78LINw0_MXyXYu03aGspC&pp=iAQB).

<!-- I'm presenting this small critique because I'm about to study eschatology from 6 different systems simultaneously. -->

> The LORD says,<br>
>>‚ÄúI will put a curse on people<br>
who trust in mere human beings,<br>
who depend on mere flesh and blood for their strength,<br>
and whose hearts have turned away from the LORD.
>
&mdash; Jeremiah 17:5 NET

Let's not forget that man made theologies like dispensationalism do not deserve your trust, none of them do. TEST ALL THINGS (1Thes. 5:21). Put your trust in Christ alone.

N. Darby the founder of the Plymouth Brethren and developed into a form of theology known as dispensational theology.** The church for 19 centuries
never heard this doctrine, never believed it, and never preached it, if you want absolute proof of it, the simplest thing in the world is to go back and read Martin Luther, John Calvin, Melancthon, Knox, all the Reformation thinkers ...

<a name="history" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">üè∫ 2. History Says Different</a>

Originating from Smyrna, Irenaeus had seen and heard the preaching of Polycarp, student of the Apostle John, and thus was <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">the last known living connection with the Apostles</span>. **Irenaeus held to Historic Premillennialism.** 

An even earlier source, Papias, another student of the Apostle John, also held to Historic Premillennialism. Makes you wonder, what it is that these dispensationalist teachers are actually teaching doesn't it.

<a name="antinomianism" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è 3. Can Introduce Antinomianism</a>

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: **Chuck Smith was a dispensationalist but he was definitely [not a dispensational antinomian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/assurance/).** If you want to stick to dispensationalism, Smith or Rhodes will teach it without antinomianism.

It's true that justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), thats common to all protestants. It's true that we are under grace and [no longer under the law](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#packer-on-legalism). The mistake this disp. sect is making is [distorting scripture and the doctrine of faith alone](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/).

> **Dispensational antinomianism** holds that keeping the moral law is at no
stage necessary for Christians, since we live under a dispensation of grace,
not of law. Romans 3:31 and 1 Corinthians 6:9‚Äì11 clearly show, however,
that law-keeping is a continuing obligation for Christians. ‚ÄòI am not free
from God‚Äôs law but am under Christ‚Äôs law,‚Äô says Paul (1 Cor. 9:21).

&mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (PhD, University of Oxford), Concise Theology. 66. Antinomianism: We are not set free to sin. On [faith](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo), on [repentance](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8).

Packer is a protestant that teaches [faith alone](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/sola-fide/), [liberty](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#packer-on-liberty) from the law, and [against the heresy of legalism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#packer-on-legalism). What he's saying is what Paul is saying in Romans 3:31. It's time for those lost in dispensational antinomianism to return to scripture. The Apostle Paul, through the inspiration of God, has provided the correction.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> What shall we say then? **Are we to remain in sin** so that grace may increase? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> **Absolutely not!** How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> What then? **Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!** &mdash; Romans 6:1-2,15 NET

These verses prove the following three things:
1. We're not under the law (Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. We're under grace (Eph 2:8-10)
3. We still don't make a "practice" of sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31).

<a name="chafer" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">üÜñ 4. Did Chafer Diminish The Gospel Message Surrounding Repentance?</a>

[**The True Meaning Of Repentance**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ. [A new group](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/) has emerged in the 80s that has diminished this 2,000 year old truth and attempted to teach that it is only assent or &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; Beware this teaching! It's not a Biblical or scholarly conclusion.

> Many understand *repentance* to mean simply a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; The weakness of this position is that, for the New Testament, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">this meaning finds no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation</span>, none of which translate metano√©≈ç and met√°noia as &ldquo;*change of mind*&rdquo; for New Testament passages. <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">It is a definition [unique to Free Grace supporters](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference works</span>.

Certain names & titles have been redacted to protect my audience from possible dangerous teachings by Chafer and the [80s Free Grace](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/) community. You can always refer to the source yourself as I've supplied it at the end of each text. It should be stated that **I do not think that [80s &ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo; Theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/) is a false gospel, only an incomplete, weakened, or diminished one**. I recommend moderate forms of protestantism instead.

> **6\. The Relationship between Dispensationalism and the 80s Free Grace Movement**
>
Historically, the initial source of the Free Grace view of the gospel was apparently not **[redacted]**, its primary advocate in the 1980s and 1990s, but Lewis Sperry Chafer, the first president of Dallas Theological Seminary, especially in his Systematic Theology, where he says, "The New Testament does not impose repentance upon the unsaved as a condition of salvation." However, Chafer's main concern was to deny that repentance had to include "sorrow and heart-anguish," so that "the way of salvation has thus been made impossible for all who do not experience the required anguish." According to Chafer, because of this mistake, people are led "to measure the validity of their salvation by the intensity of anguish which preceded or accompanied it. It is in this manner that sorrow of heart becomes a more subtle form of meritorious work, and to that extent a contradiction of grace.... To imply, as preachers have done so generally, that God must be mollified... by human agony is a desperate form of unbelief."35
>
Although my definition of repentance (p. 865) includes "a heartfelt sorrow for sin," **I would agree with Chafer that we should not tell people to "measure the validity of their salvation by the intensity of the anguish which preceded or accompanied it."** Therefore **I have some sympathy with Chafer's opposition to this pastoral mistake**, which he apparently thought was too prevalent in his day. But I think he over-corrected the mistake by insisting that repentance only required a change of mind.
>
**Chafer was a leading proponent of dispensationalism** (see pp. 656, 1054) and the president of Dallas Theological Seminary from 1924 to 1952, but not all Dallas Seminary faculty or all who advocate Dispensational theology would hold a Free Grace view A controversy over this point erupted in American evangelicalism in 1988 when John MacArthur, himself a Dispensationalist, published The Gospel according to Jesus. This book, which features enthusiastic forewords by J. I. Packer and James Montgomery Boice, strongly criticized the views of writers like Chafer and **[redacted]** on evangelism and the nature of saving faith. MacArthur argued (I think convincingly) from many New Testament passages that one cannot truly accept Christ as Savior without also accepting him as Lord or, in other words, that there can be no true saving faith without genuine repentance in the sense of a commitment to forsake sin and walk in obedience to Christ as well. He said that any other view preaches a cheap gospel that offers unconverted people false security, telling them they are saved simply because they agreed that the facts of the gospel were true or prayed a prayer, but they had no true repentance and no real change of life. MacArthur argued that **such unbiblical evangelism has never been the teaching of the church through history and that the weakened gospel** heard so often as a result of Free Grace teaching has led to a whole generation of professing Christians whose lives are no different from the surrounding culture and who are **really not saved at all**. **[redacted]** quickly responded to MacArthur with another book,
>
**[redacted]**. As I have argued in this chapter, it seems clear that MacArthur was right to maintain that true saving faith in New Testament terms is more than mere intellectual assent to facts; it must include a heartfelt coming to Christ in personal dependence on him for salvation, combined with a heartfelt repentance from sin. **It is misleading to brand this teaching "Lordship salvation" as if it were some new doctrine or as if there were any other kind of salvation&mdash;MacArthur is teaching what has been the historic position of Christian orthodoxy on this matter.** This position is **not salvation by works** but simply states the gospel of free grace and salvation by grace through faith in all its biblical fullness. The change of life that will **result** from genuine conversion does not save us, but it will certainly result if our faith is genuine, for **"faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead" (James 2:17)**.

I feel just as betrayed as Heiser, as I was also raised in dispensational theology, and held to it for half my life.

I'm gonna say this; with a few of them, you really can say things like, they just gotta make stuff up to make it work. **I was raised in classic dispensational thought, that was my first Christian context.** And classic dispensationalism is Charles Ryrie and CI Scofield, those guys. And Ryrie got to the point where he had to... you have to understand; classic dispensationalism, I've been trying to teach you that prophecy is already but not yet. You got both things working. Classic dispensationalism says "there is no already. It's all not yet." And so, when **Ryrie would get cornered on like Kingdom language** and stuff like this, he literally in one of his books, he wanted so badly for the New Covenant to not be fulfilled in the New Testament. That **he said "well then we need to expect a New-New Covenant." Like he just made up a New-New Covenant, like right there in a book.** Okay, can I invent something and have a system too? Is that the new ground rule now? Like you just make one up? I'm going to call my covenant, the Mike Covenant. **You'll see stuff like this happen.** That when you look back on it, it makes you laugh, but like he was serious, he was serious about this.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: This is technically a critique on pretribulational rapture, an option of premillennialism that can be made when selecting an eschatological system. It can exist independently from dispensationalism.

> The Rapture is a belief that Jesus Christ will return initially for the church. He will come‚Äîbut not quite to earth. Here‚Äôs how: Jesus will come, and then the church will be taken up to meet him. This view of the rapture is prominent in a system of theology called premillennial dispensationalism. 
>
But here‚Äôs the problem: you end up with two second comings. 
>
You get Jesus coming the first time for the church to rapture them away. 
>
Then after a period of tribulation he comes again for the second time. This is the second part of the second coming, second coming 2.B where he comes with the church largely in judgment to rescue those who also became believers during a great period of great tribulation.
>
However, this isn‚Äôt what the Bible says about the rapture. The New Testament doesn‚Äôt split up the second coming of Jesus along those lines. 
>
Instead, the second coming of Jesus is more singular, more unitary, more comprehensive, more definitive. There is a period of tribulation or trial that comes upon the world. There's apostasy, and there's persecution, the sort of thing spoken about in 1 Thessalonians. Then at the end of that, after a period of tribulation, Christ returns. 
>
It's not that the church is raptured to go meet him, but rather he returns definitively. 
>
As Paul says, he then hands over the kingdom to the Father. This is the moment where Jesus will be by might what he is by right, Lord of all.

<a name="jews" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">‚ú°Ô∏è 8. Some Dispensationalists Twist The Scriptures In Revelation To Silence Other Christian Groups</a>

A common attack you might come across when speaking to a Dispensationalist is the one where they take Revelation 2:9 out of context to attack replacement theologians. I myself am not a replacement theologian or strict dispensationalist, but at the same time, I think these behaviors and interpretations by dispensationalists are in bad taste and fruitless.

> ‚Äú‚ÄòI know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. &mdash; Revelation 2:9 (cf. Rev 3:9).

Dispensationalists incorrectly attempt to use this verse to silence anyone who would say that they are grafted in as Jews (figuratively) which is what the Bible teaches (Romans 11:16-24 NLT; Galatians 3:29 NLT). **What some dispensationalists don't know is that this verse is about false professors, those without genuine saving faith (a faith that results in obedience to God, repentance, and good works, that follow after we're justified by faith alone.)** In other words, it's talking about those with a dead faith (James 2:14-26), false professors without the Holy Spirit (Gal 5:19-23). While those with a living faith are Jews (figuratively).

> And I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not; who asserted themselves to be the true Israel of God, Jews that were so inwardly, regenerate persons, or truly Christians; for the Christians, baptized persons (m), were by the Heathens called Jews; but these were not, **they professed Christianity in words, but in works denied it; they were men of bad principles and practices, and both blasphemed the ways and doctrines of Christ** themselves, and caused them to be blasphemed by others also; they were false Christians, nominal professors, and shunned persecution for the Gospel; who were not what they would be thought to be: these were the broachers of heresies in this period of time, in which there was a multitude of them, and which chiefly respected the doctrine of the Trinity, and the person of Christ; and they were introducers of Pagan and Jewish rites into the church, and were **men of flagitious lives** and conversations, and paved the way for the man of sin: ...

Those who say they are Jews and are not are either Jewish proselytes or **Jews who refuse to believe the scriptural proof that Jesus is the promised Messiah** (see Rom. 2:28, 29).
