> I must call the NRSVueâ€™s rendering of 1 Corinthians what it is: a removal of something Paul said by the inspiration of the Spirit. &mdash; [Dr. Mark Ward (PhD, Bob Jones University)](https://www.youtube.com/@markwardonwords)

While this video is primarily about the NRSVue and it's short comings, The NLT has 1 of the problems mentioned in this video, specifically 1 Corinthians 6:9. [Dr. Mark Ward (PhD, Bob Jones University)](https://www.youtube.com/@markwardonwords), author of [Authorized](https://amzn.to/3SYHVT3), has brought to my attention, a particularly dangerous error that has found it's way into one of the best dynamic translations ever made. If you own an NLT and a [pen](https://amzn.to/3WDHFdd), correct this in your bible.

After going through and meticulously applying every litmus test I could possibly think of to find the very best Bible versions, the NLT won best dynamic translation and was top 3 overall out of 62+ bible versions. So as you can imagine my disappointed to find this imperfection. While only two versions remain, the NLT is still a very fine Bible version, in fact still better than 59 others, so if you own or buy this version, just mark this verse with the proper translation.
