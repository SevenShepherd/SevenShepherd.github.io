**Characteristics of a Cult.** Some of the items in this list alone are not enough to classify a group as a cult or necessarily even negative in and of themselves but when put together if a group fits all or nearly all of the elements in this list then we're beginning to see how it would
be legitimate to classify them that way.

1. The group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous unquestioning commitment.
2. The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.
3. The group is preoccupied with making money.
4. Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
5. Mind-numbing techniques, [such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, debilitating work routines], are used to suppress doubts about the group or its leader
6. the leadership dictates sometimes, in great detail, how members should think act and feel [for example members must get permission from leaders to date, change jobs, get married; leaders may prescribe what type of clothes to wear, where to live, how to discipline children
and so forth].
7. The group is elitist, claiming a special exalted status for itself, its leaders and members [for example: the leader is considered the
messiah, or an avatar; the group and/or the leader has a special mission to save humanity].
8. The group has a polarized
us versus them mentality which causes conflict with the wider society.
9. The group's leader is not accountable to any authorities [as are for example
military commanders and ministers
priests monks and rabbis of mainstream
denominations]. The group teaches or implies that
supposedly exalted ends justify means
that members would have considered
unethical before joining the group
[for example collecting money for bogus
charities].
10. The leadership induces feeling
of guilt in members in order to control
them
11. Members subservience to the
group causes them to cut ties with
family friends and personal group goals and
activities that were of interest before
joining the group
12. Members are expected to devote
inordinate amounts of time to the group
13. Members are encouraged or required to live and or socialize only with other group members.
