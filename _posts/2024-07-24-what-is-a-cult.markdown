<a name="Characteristics" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">‚ò†Ô∏è I. Characteristics of a Cult</a>

Some of the items in this list alone are not enough to classify a group as a cult, but when put together, if a group fits all or nearly all of the elements in this list, then it would be legitimate to classify them that way.

1. The group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous unquestioning commitment.
2. The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.
3. The group is preoccupied with making money.
4. Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
5. Mind-numbing techniques, [such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, debilitating work routines], are used to suppress doubts about the group or its leader
6. the leadership dictates sometimes, in great detail, how members should think act and feel [for example members must get permission from leaders to date, change jobs, get married; leaders may prescribe what type of clothes to wear, where to live, how to discipline children
and so forth].
7. The group is elitist, claiming a special exalted status for itself, its leaders and members [for example: the leader is considered the
messiah, or an avatar; the group and/or the leader has a special mission to save humanity].
8. The group has a polarized
us versus them mentality which causes conflict with the wider society.
9. The group's leader is not accountable to any authorities [as are for example military commanders and ministers priests monks and rabbis of mainstream denominations]. The group teaches or implies that supposedly exalted ends justify means that members would have considered unethical before joining the group [for example collecting money for bogus
charities].
10. The leadership induces feeling
of guilt in members in order to control
them
11. Members subservience to the
group causes them to cut ties with
family friends and personal group goals and
activities that were of interest before
joining the group
12. Members are expected to devote
inordinate amounts of time to the group
13. Members are encouraged or required to live and or socialize only with other group members.

<!-- <sup style="font-style:italic;">GPT-4-turbo</sup> -->

> The sociological sense is used when discussing behavior or other sociological aspects: a group or movement may be a cult if it acts in ways that are illegal or otherwise unacceptable in a civilized society. &mdash; [Sociological sense of the term cult.](https://www.cultdefinition.com/#cult-meanings-of-the-term-vary)

> The theological sense is used when discussing major religious differences: a group or movement is theologically a cult if it identifies itself as belonging to a mainstream, recognized religion ‚Äî and yet rejects or otherwise violates one or more of the central, essential teachings of that religion. &mdash; [Theological sense of the term cult.](https://www.cultdefinition.com/#cult-meanings-of-the-term-vary)

<a name="List-Of-Heretical-Sects" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üíÄ III. List Of Heretical Sects Also Known As Theological Cults</a>

> The theological sense is used when discussing major religious differences: a group or movement is theologically a cult if it identifies itself as belonging to a mainstream, recognized religion ‚Äî and yet rejects or otherwise violates one or more of the central, essential teachings of that religion. &mdash; [Theological sense of the term cult.](https://www.cultdefinition.com/#cult-meanings-of-the-term-vary)

1. Verses against legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28).

<!-- ### Criteria for Ranking:

This ranking highlights heretical sects based on their divergence from orthodox Christian teachings and their impact on church history. The influence of these sects varied widely, with some persisting for centuries and others being quickly condemned and marginalized.

- **Theological Deviation**: Degree to which the sect's beliefs diverge from orthodox Christian doctrine.
- **Historical Impact**: The extent to which the sect influenced or challenged the early church and its doctrines.
- **Persistence**: How long the sect's beliefs continued to influence or challenge mainstream Christianity. -->

<a name="Legalism" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">3.1 Legalistic Heretical Sects or Theological Cults</a>

![Legalism](/assets/images/legalist-meme.jpg)

> 65\. LEGALISM<br>
> WORKING FOR GOD‚ÄôS FAVOUR FORFEITS IT
>
>> . . . do not do what they do, for they do not practise what they preach. They tie up heavy loads and put them on men‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for men to see . . . Matthew 23:3‚Äì5
>
> The New Testament views Christian obedience as the practice of ‚Äògood deeds‚Äô (works). Christians are to be ‚Äòrich in good deeds‚Äô (1 Tim. 6:18; cf. Matt. 5:16; Eph. 2:10; 2 Tim. 3:17; Titus 2:7, 14; 3:8, 14). A good deed is one done (a) according to the right standard (God‚Äôs revealed will, i.e. his moral law); (b) from a right motive (the love to God and others that marks the regenerate heart); (c) with a right purpose (pleasing and glorifying God, honouring Christ, advancing his kingdom, and benefiting one‚Äôs neighbour).
>
> Legalism is a distortion of obedience that can never produce truly good works. Its first fault is that it skews motive and purpose, seeing good deeds as essentially ways to earn more of God‚Äôs favour than one has at the moment. Its second fault is arrogance. Belief that one‚Äôs labour earns God‚Äôs favour begets contempt for those who do not labour in the same way. Its third fault is love-lessness in that its self-advancing purpose squeezes humble kindness and creative compassion out of the heart.
>
> In the New Testament we meet both Pharisaic and Judaizing legalism. The Pharisees thought that their status as children of Abraham made God‚Äôs pleasure in them possible, and that their formalized daily law-keeping, down to minutest details, would make it actual. The Judaizers viewed Gentile evangelism as a form of proselytizing for Judaism; they believed that the Gentile believer in Christ must go on to become a Jew by circumcision and observance of the festal calendar and ritual law, and that thus he would gain increased favour with God. Jesus attacked the Pharisees; Paul, the Judaizers.
>
> The Pharisees were formalists, focusing entirely on the externals of action, disregarding motives and purposes, and reducing life to mechanical rule-keeping. They thought themselves faithful law-keepers although (a) they majored in minors, neglecting what matters most (Matt. 23:23‚Äì24); (b) their casuistry negated the law‚Äôs spirit and aim (Matt. 15:3‚Äì9; 23:16‚Äì24); (c) they treated traditions of practice as part of God‚Äôs authoritative law, thus binding consciences where God had left them free (Mark 2:16 ‚Äì 3:6; 7:1‚Äì8); (d) they were hypocrites at heart, angling for man‚Äôs approval all the time (Luke 20:45‚Äì47; Matt. 6:1‚Äì8; 23:2‚Äì7). Jesus was very sharp with them on these points.
>
> In Galatians, Paul condemns the Judaizers‚Äô ‚ÄòChrist-plus‚Äô message as obscuring and indeed denying the all-sufficiency of the grace revealed in Jesus (Gal. 3:1‚Äì3; 4:21; 5:2‚Äì6). In Colossians, he conducts a similar polemic against a similar ‚ÄòChrist-plus‚Äô formula for ‚Äòfullness‚Äô (i.e. spiritual completion: Col. 2:8‚Äì23). Any ‚Äòplus‚Äô that requires us to take action in order to add to what Christ has given us is a reversion to legalism and, in truth, an insult to Christ.
>
> So far, then, from enriching our relationship with God, as it seeks to do, legalism in all its forms does the opposite. It puts that relationship in jeopardy and, by stopping us focusing on Christ, it starves our souls while feeding our pride. **Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague.**

### 1. [*&ldquo;Jehovah's&rdquo;* Witnesses (Watchtowerites)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/cults/)
- **Founded**: Late 19th century by Charles Taze Russell.
- **Notoriety**: [142 deviations](https://youtu.be/_gZe6BCuCa4?si=mmHLyS_KQkxnaa_u) from Christianity, including [essential doctrine](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/essential-doctrine/). 
    - Denial of the Trinity.
    - [Denial of Jesus deity](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/deity/).
    - Denial of bodily resurrection (1Co 15:14,17; John 2:19-21; Luke 24:36-39; John 20:27).
    - Denial of Body & Soul (2Cor 5:8; Phil 1:21-23; Lk 23:43; Mt 10:28).
    - Denial of Beast & False Prophet burning alive for 1000 years and then for eternity (Re 19:11-14,20; 20:10).
    - Denial of 144,000 being Jewish, virgin, men (Re 7:4; 14:4).

### 2. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)
- **Founded**: Early 19th century by Joseph Smith.
- **Notoriety**: False views on the Trinity being separate entities instead of God in three distinct persons. They think they can become gods and are in denial of Isaiah 43:10. 
- The Joseph Smith Papyri, used by Joseph Smith to produce the Book of Abraham, were initially believed to contain the writings of the biblical Abraham by Mormons. However, when the surviving fragments were re-examined by Egyptologists in the 20th century, they were identified as standard Egyptian funerary texts, including the "Book of Breathing" and the "Book of the Dead." These findings completely debunked the Latter-day Saint community.

<!-- ### 1. **Arianism**
- **Leader**: Arius
- **Notoriety**: Denied the full divinity of Jesus Christ, teaching that He was a created being.
- **Impact**: Led to significant theological conflict and was condemned at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. Despite this, Arianism had a profound influence on the early church and persisted for centuries.

### 3. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)
- **Founded**: Early 19th century by Joseph Smith.
- **Key Beliefs**:
  - Additional Scriptures: Accept the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture in addition to the Bible.
  - Godhead: Falsely believe in the Godhead as three distinct beings: God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, rather than the traditional Trinity.
  - Eternal Progression: Teach that humans can become gods in the afterlife through a process of eternal progression.
  - Plan of Salvation: Unique view on pre-mortal existence, earthly life, and post-mortal existence, including temple rituals and proxy baptisms for the dead.
  - Prophetic Leadership: Believe in modern-day prophets and continuing revelation.
- **Impact**: The LDS Church has grown significantly worldwide and has a substantial cultural and theological impact. Its distinct beliefs and additional scriptures set it apart from mainstream Christianity.

### 4. **Nestorianism**
- **Leader**: Nestorius
- **Notoriety**: Falsely taught that Jesus Christ had two separate persons, one divine and one human.
- **Impact**: Led to the Nestorian Schism and the formation of the Church of the East, which spread across Asia. Condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD.

### 5. **Pelagianism**
- **Leader**: Pelagius
- **Notoriety**: Denied original sin and taught that humans could achieve salvation through their own efforts without divine grace.
- **Impact**: Led to significant theological debate, notably with Augustine of Hippo, and was condemned at the Council of Carthage in 418 AD.

### 6. **Socinianism**
- **Notoriety**: Denied the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, and the atonement, promoting a rationalistic approach to Scripture.
- **Impact**: Influenced later Unitarian movements and faced opposition from both Protestant and Catholic authorities.

<a name="Antinomianism" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">3.2 Antinomian Heretical Sects or Theological Cults</a>

![Antinomianism](/assets/images/antinomianism.jpg)

<a name="Dualistic" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2.1 Dualistic Antinomianism</a>

> **Dualistic antinomianism** appears in the Gnostic heretics against whom Jude and Peter wrote (Jude 4‚Äì19; 2 Pet. 2). This view sees salvation as for the soul only, and bodily behaviour as irrelevant both to God‚Äôs interest and to the soul‚Äôs health, so one may behave riotously and it will not matter. <a name="Packer-Dualistic" href="#Packer"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚óä</sup></a>

### Gnosticism
- **Founded**: Gnosticism, emerging from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD, is a complex religious movement characterized by esoteric knowledge for salvation and a dualistic worldview. Key figures include Simon Magus (mid-1st century; Acts 8:9-24), Valentinus (active around 136-165 AD), and Basilides (active around 117-138 AD). The movement lacks a precise founding date and is influenced by Jewish, Christian, and Hellenistic thought. Thus, Gnosticism as a movement developed over a period of time, roughly from the 1st to the 3rd centuries AD, without a single founding year or individual.
- **Notoriety**: Dualistic antinomianism. These are likely the false teachers the Apostle Peter warned us about in 2 Peter 2:1-2,12,17,19.

<a name="Spirit-centred" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2.2 Spirit-Centred Antinomianism</a>

> **Spirit-centred antinomianism** puts such trust in the Holy Spirit‚Äôs inward prompting as to deny any need to be taught by the law how to live. Freedom from the law as a way of salvation is assumed to bring with it freedom from the law as a guide to conduct. In the first hundred and fifty years of the Reformation era this kind of antinomianism often threatened, and Paul‚Äôs insistence that a truly spiritual person acknowledges the authority of God‚Äôs Word through Christ‚Äôs apostles (1 Cor. 14:37; cf. 7:40) suggests that the Spirit-obsessed Corinthian church was in the grip of the same mindset. <a name="Packer-Spirit" href="#Packer"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚óä</sup></a>

<a name="Christ-centred" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2.3 Christ-centred Antinomianism</a>

> **Christ-centred antinomianism** argues that God sees no sin in believers, because they are in Christ, who kept the law for them, and therefore <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">what they actually do makes no difference</span>, provided that they keep believing. But 1 John 1:8 ‚Äì 2:1 (expounding 1Jn 1:7) and 1Jn 3:4‚Äì10 point in a different direction, showing that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">it is not possible to be in Christ and at the same time to embrace sin as a way of life.</span> <a name="Packer-C-Centered" href="#Packer"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚óä</sup></a>

![Repent-Meme](/assets/images/repent-meme.jpg)

### 1. Hyper-Grace Movement

<sup style="font-style:italic;">Includes the [Extreme 80's &ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo; movement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), as they have near identical false teachings on faith and [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).</sup>


<!-- Eerily reminiscent to the theological cult (heretical sect) known as the <a href="#Antinomianism">hyper-grace movement</a>. It's more extreme variant might as well be the same teaching.  -->

<!-- - **Notoriety**: False teachings on faith and [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/), erroneously teaching both of them to be assent, when instead faith is not only the assent of our minds but trust & reliance on Christ, and repentance is a remorse & conversion according to every authoritative greek lexicon, dictionary, English Bible translations, and 1,000s of biblical language scholars. -->

**Founded**: [Chaferanism](](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)) was systematized in the 1980s. This movements false teachings on the meaning of faith & repentance bled into the heretical sect known as the Hyper Grace movement. The hyper-grace heresy began to take shape in the early 2000s. One of the most prominent figures associated with the Hyper-Grace movement is Joseph Prince, a false teacher and heretic from Singapore.

<!-- - **Notoriety**: The Hyper-Grace heretics **falsely teach** that faith & [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) are only assent changes in the head and are synonyms. When in reality, faith is not only the assent of our minds but a trust & reliance on Christ, while  [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ.
- **Outcome**: **They live in complete denial of what the scriptures, the academic community, and lexicons state.** They're indoctrinating innocent children into [lifestyles of sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/) and false assurance, causing them to apostatize (Lk 17:2). Hyper-Grace members live in denial of 2 Corinthians 13:5, arguing that it leads to self examination and doubt. -->

1. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Faith is not only the assent of our minds, but a trust & reliance on Christ. It is a *believing trust* or a *trustful belief*. Faith is composed of notitia ('knowledge'), assensus (‚Äòagreement‚Äô), and fiducia (‚Äòtrust and reliance‚Äô).</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">Even though the Apostle James debunks assent to facts as salvific (James 2:19), as does our most authoritative lexicons (BDAG), false teachers will strip fiducia (‚Äòtrust and reliance‚Äô) from the meaning of faith. They tamper with essential doctrine.</span>

    > Christian theologians have never seen faith simply in terms of intellectual assent to Christian belief. It is a matter of the heart, not simply the mind, involving personal commitment. As the English theologian William Temple (1881‚Äì1944) once pointed out: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">‚ÄúFaith is not only the assent of our minds to doctrinal propositions: it is the commitment of our whole selves into the hands of a faithful Creator and merciful Redeemer.‚Äù</span> ...
    >
    > <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Faith is about trust in God, rather than just accepting that God exists.</span>
    >
    > &mdash; Dr. Alister McGrath (Ph.D., Molecular Biophysics at Oxford; D.D. Theology at Oxford; D.Litt. Intellectual History at Oxford), Theology - The Basics, Faith. p. 1,4.

2. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">[**The applied meaning of repentance**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5; Lk 13:3). Repentance is clearly a contrition and a hatred for sin (Jd 22-23).</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">False teachers will teach that faith & repentance are only assent changes in the head and are synonyms. By doing so they erase Christ's call to repent and diminish the gospel (Mk 1:14-15; Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).</span>

    > Many understand *repentance* to mean simply a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; The weakness of this position is that, for the New Testament, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">this meaning finds no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation</span>, none of which translate metano√©≈ç and met√°noia as &ldquo;*change of mind*&rdquo; for New Testament passages. <span style="font-style:italic;color:ForestGreen;">It is a definition [unique to Free Grace supporters](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference works</span>. It also lacks support from any English translation of the Bible.

3. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">[Assurance of salvation](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/) is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT).</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">False teachers live in denial of the scriptures (2Cor 13:5), arguing that it leads to self-examination and doubt. Perhaps we should not be giving false assurance to rapists, murderers, and pedophiles who have no intention to repent (aka. turn from their sins).</span>

    If you are unrepentant (Lk 13:3) and you pursue lifestyles of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Gal 5:19-21) the only assurance you have, is no assurance. This is your wake up call (Re 3:3). You should be told to test to see if your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), to see if you really are trusting in Christ, because if you were, you'd be repentant, you'd carry your cross daily (Mt 10:38; Lk 9:23), you'd be bearing the fruits of obedience (John 15:1-17; James 2:14-26; Jn 14:15; 1 Jn 2:4), and you'd have the assurance of being foreknown (Mt 22:14). These are divine enablements.

    > Do not be deceived, if you are walking after the flesh and involved in the things of the flesh, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">you have no assurance of being in the Kingdom of Heaven</span> &mdash; [**Chuck Smith (YouTube Short)**](https://youtube.com/shorts/aBG9kH-z8Q8?si=_jqYQqF6bgbN9TZZ)

    It will help you to make the distinction between **(1)** justification, which is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and **(2)** assurance of salvation, which is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT; Jn 14:15,21). &ldquo;*we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.*... *That is how we know we are living in him.*&rdquo;<sup style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/">‚Ä†</a></sup>

4. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Anyone who can say *"Jesus is Lord,"* and mean it, does so by the power of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). &ldquo;If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.&rdquo; (Romans 10:9 NLT)</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">False teachers only want Jesus *"as savior"* but deny him *"as Lord"* over their lives (Jd 4 NET; 2Pe 2:1-2 NET). Both are true for the saved, as Christianity is a call to discipleship (Mt 10:38 NLT; Lk 9:23; 14:27).</span>

    > Jesus on another occasion said, "Why do you call me Lord and yet you don‚Äôt do the things that I command you?" You see, our problem is that we‚Äôve come to think of the term "Lord" as a name and so we say, "The Lord Jesus Christ" and we think of Lord as His first name, Jesus His middle name and Christ His last name; He‚Äôs the Lord Jesus Christ. **But in reality when I say the Lord, you should put a comma there for Lord is not his name; it‚Äôs His title. The title that signifies my relationship to Him. <span style="color:#29a329;">He is my Lord, I am his slave; I am his servant, He is my Lord.</span>** &mdash; Chuck Smith C2000

    > The idea that there can be saving faith without repentance, and that one can be justified by **embracing Christ as Saviour while refusing him as Lord, is a destructive delusion**.

5. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">False teachers exploit the vulnerability of innocent children, leading them into patterns of sin and false security (Lk 17:2). They mislead them by twisting the scriptures to falsely imply that *‚Äúeveryone sins‚Äù* to encourage antinomian behavior (Rom 1:32), thereby abusing the grace of God as a license for immoral conduct (Jd 4 NET). Additionally, they distort the true nature of repentance, reducing it to a mere *‚Äúchange of mind‚Äù* rather than the genuine contrition and turning away from sin that is consistently affirmed by authoritative Greek lexicons (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5; Lk 13:3). This manipulation not only undermines their spiritual integrity but also paves the way for apostasy.</span>

    ‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone has sin (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

    <!-- becoming reminiscent of false teachers -->

    Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.

It is unfathomable to me that there is a group of people out there telling murderers, rapists, and pedophiles, that all they have to do is *&ldquo;change their minds,&rdquo;* not repent and turn away from what they're doing.

> You can say that you are sorry for what you have done but if you continue to do it, that is not true repentance. **Real repentance is being so sorry, so contrite, that you do not do it again. You turn away from it and cease doing it.** If a person declares that they have repented of a certain action or sin, and they continue in that same action, there is good reason to doubt the genuineness of the repentance.

<a name="Dispensational" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2.4 Dispensational Antinomianism</a>

> **Dispensational antinomianism** holds that keeping the moral law is at no stage necessary for Christians, since we live under a dispensation of grace, not of law. Romans 3:31 and 1 Corinthians 6:9‚Äì11 clearly show, however, that law-keeping is a continuing obligation for Christians. ‚ÄòI am not free from God‚Äôs law but am under Christ‚Äôs law,‚Äô says Paul (1 Cor. 9:21). <a name="Packer-Dispensational" href="#Packer"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚óä</sup></a>

> **Dialectical antinomianism**, as in Barth and Brunner, denies that biblical law is God‚Äôs direct command and affirms that the Bible‚Äôs imperative statements trigger the Word of the Spirit, which when it comes may or may not correspond exactly to what is written. The inadequacy of the neoorthodox view of biblical authority, which explains the inspiration of Scripture in terms of the Bible‚Äôs instrumentality as a channel for God‚Äôs present-day utterances to his people, is evident here. <a name="Packer-Dialectical" href="#Packer"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚óä</sup></a>

<a name="Situationist" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2.6 Situationist Antinomianism</a>

> **Situationist antinomianism** says that a motive and intention of love is all that God now requires of Christians, and the commands of the Decalogue and other ethical parts of Scripture, for all that they are ascribed to God directly, are mere rules of thumb for loving, rules that love may at any time disregard. But Romans 13:8‚Äì10, to which this view appeals, teaches that without love as a motive these specific commands cannot be fulfilled. Once more an unacceptably weak view of Scripture surfaces. <a name="Packer-Situationist" href="#Packer"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚óä</sup></a>

<!-- >
> It must be stressed that the moral law, as crystallized in the Decalogue and opened up in the ethical teaching of both Testaments, is one coherent law, given to be a code of practice for God‚Äôs people in every age. In addition, repentance means resolving henceforth to seek God‚Äôs help in keeping that law. The Spirit is given to empower law-keeping and make us more and more like Christ, the archetypal law-keeper (Matt. 5:17). This law-keeping is in fact the fulfilling of our human nature, and Scripture holds out no hope of salvation for any who, whatever their profession of faith, do not seek to turn from sin to righteousness (1 Cor. 6:9‚Äì11; Rev. 21:8). <a name="contents" href="#Packer"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚óä</sup></a> -->


<!-- ### 1. Theological Liberalism -->

<!-- Gnosticism is a diverse and complex religious movement that emerged in the early centuries of the Common Era, roughly between the 1st and 3rd centuries. It is not attributed to a single founder, as it encompasses a variety of beliefs and practices. Gnostic ideas were influenced by a mix of Jewish, Christian, and Hellenistic thought.

Key figures associated with early Gnostic thought include:

1. **Simon Magus**: A Samaritan magician mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, who is often considered an early Gnostic figure.
2. **Valentinus**: A prominent Gnostic teacher in the 2nd century who founded the Valentinian school of Gnosticism.
3. **Basilides**: Another influential Gnostic teacher from the 2nd century, who developed his own cosmology and theological system.
4. **Marcion**: Although not a Gnostic per se, his teachings had some Gnostic elements, particularly his dualistic view of the world.

Gnosticism as a movement is characterized by its emphasis on esoteric knowledge (gnosis) for salvation, a dualistic worldview, and a distinct cosmology involving emanations and lesser divinities. It was largely deemed heretical by orthodox Christianity and thus suppressed, with much of what we know about it coming from the writings of its opponents and the discovery of Gnostic texts like those found in the Nag Hammadi library in 1945.


Gnosticism, as a religious and philosophical movement, lacks a precise founding date. However, its development can be traced to specific centuries:

- **1st Century CE**: Early forms of Gnostic thought begin to emerge. Simon Magus, who is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, is sometimes considered an early Gnostic figure. His activities are typically dated to the mid-1st century.
- **2nd Century CE**: Gnosticism becomes more structured and prominent. Key figures such as Valentinus and Basilides are active during this period. Valentinus is believed to have taught in Rome around 136-165 CE. Basilides was active in Alexandria around 117-138 CE.
- **3rd Century CE**: Gnostic ideas continue to evolve and spread. Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, a religion with Gnostic elements, was active in the mid-3rd century (around 216-276 CE). -->



<!-- 
### 1. **Docetism**
- **Notoriety**: Falsely believed that Jesus' physical body was an illusion and that He did not truly suffer on the cross.
- **Impact**: Faced strong opposition from early church fathers, including Ignatius of Antioch, and was condemned as heretical.

### 3. Hyper-Grace Movement

- **Origins**: Late 20th century, within various charismatic and evangelical circles.
- **Key Beliefs**: Emphasis on God's grace to the exclusion of moral law and repentance, often perceived as antinomian heresy.
- **Classification**: Considered a heretical sect by mainstream Christianity for downplaying the importance of moral law (Ro 3:31; 6:1-2,15).

### 6. **Marcionism**
- **Leader**: Marcion
- **Notoriety**: Rejected the Old Testament and taught that the God of the Old Testament was different from the God of the New Testament.
- **Impact**: Marcionism prompted early Christians to formalize the New Testament canon. It was condemned by the early church.

### 9. **Montanism**
- **Leaders**: Montanus, Priscilla, Maximilla
- **Notoriety**: Claimed new prophetic revelations that superseded the teachings of the apostles.
- **Impact**: Early church condemned it for its radical views and practices, though it persisted for several centuries.

### 4. **Gnosticism**
- **Notoriety**: Emphasized secret knowledge (gnosis) for salvation and often denied the material world's goodness. Gnostic texts presented an alternative narrative to orthodox Christianity.
- **Impact**: Gnosticism presented a major theological challenge to early Christianity and was condemned by many early church fathers. -->

<!-- This group is more difficult to brand as legalistic because they still claim unity with Eph 2:8-10 and Rom 3:28. Many of them, even though they are synergistic (faith + works), still do not believe they are meriting (earning) justification. If they truly believe they are not meriting then they are not heretical, but their understanding of works in relationship to faith is uncomfortably skewed. -->

Labeling this group as legalistic is challenging because they profess alignment with Ephesians 2:8-10 and Romans 3:28, emphasizing salvation by grace through faith. Although they adopt a synergistic approach that integrates faith and works, many do not view themselves as earning justification. If their belief in this regard is sincere, they avoid heresy. However, their perception of the interplay between works and faith remains notably misaligned.

> In Galatians, Paul condemns the Judaizers‚Äô ‚ÄòChrist-plus‚Äô message as obscuring and indeed denying the all-sufficiency of the grace revealed in Jesus (Gal. 3:1‚Äì3; 4:21; 5:2‚Äì6).

### 2. Lutheranism
- **Founded**: Lutheranism was founded in the early 16th century as part of the Protestant Reformation. Its origins can be traced back to Martin Luther, a German monk and theologian, who challenged the practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.
- **Notoriety**: Synergism.

### 3. Arminianism
- **Founded**: Arminianism was founded by Jacobus Arminius, a Dutch theologian, in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
- **Notoriety**: Synergism.
- See <a href="#Orthodoxy">Orthodox Christian Groups</a> for Reformed Arminianism (Reformed Wesleyanism).

> Arminians view regeneration synergistically; the new birth occurs as a result of human willing and divine working. ...

> Furthermore, some affirm that God wills that sanctification be perfected in this life by a second work of grace that is said to eradicate the sinful nature and its desires, fill the heart with perfect love for God, and enable Christians to live without willful sin.

>
>In addition, many Arminians deny the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. They insist that by deliberate sin Christians can renounce their prior faith commitment and thereby fall from the state of grace, forfeit eternal salvation, and be doomed to perdition. The Arminian understanding of salvation thus is synergistic (a ‚Äúworking together‚Äù); divine grace and the liberated human will cooperate to bring about salvation.

### 2. Orthodox Calvinism (Scholastic Calvinism)
- **Founded**: Calvinism was founded by John Calvin, a French theologian and pastor, in the mid-16th century. Calvin's influential work, "Institutes of the Christian Religion," first published in **1536**, laid the foundational doctrines of what would later be called Calvinism.

Lutherans and Anglicans both confess divine predestination while simultaneously affirming a universal atonement and the universal offer of the gospel. <sup>146</sup> On the Anglican side, D. B. Knox, a much-neglected Australian Anglican theologian, stands in this tradition of Anglican Calvinism with a universal view of the atonement.<sup>147</sup> For Knox, the work of Christ extends uniformly to the whole of humanity, and this is clear when based around certain theological tenets.

### 3. KJV Onlyism
- **Notoriety**: turns a blind eye to biblical language scholarship. Worships the creation rather than the creator. In denial of Daniel 12:4 which states that knowledge will be increased. Logically our English translations will increase in [accuracy](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/) as well.
    - [The Textus Receptus](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/) was composed by a Catholic Priest named Erasmus. (KJV, NKJV).
    - The TR was not historically received by all or even by Erasmus himself as there are 27 different and conflicting Textus Receptus‚Äô. 
    - Erasmus felt that the doctrine of *Faith Alone* was not supported in the bible in the simplistic way Luther proposed.
    - Erasmus only used around 3 manuscripts to produce the severely anemic Textus Receptus. There are approximately 5000 mss of the Byzantine MT. So it‚Äôs not actually Majority text by methodology.
    - Erasmus lacked the last leaf of Revelation, back translated from a defective copy of the Latin Vulgate, and created 20 errors that don‚Äôt exist in any Greek mss, botching the last 6 verses of revelation, the very place the bible warns not to get wrong! **Not Recommended**

> "**99.8% of textual variants affect nothing**, most are spelling differences. there's different ways to spell John, there's different ways to spell Mary, they're not going to affect anything, but **the one-fifth of 1% that do affect things are the ones that scholars talk about**. The bottom line is it does not matter in some respects which New Testament you use because **no essential doctrine is jeopardized** by any of these textual variants" &mdash; [Professor Daniel B. Wallace, Ph.D., Executive Director, Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts](https://youtu.be/NikVdhp0YFs).

![Sound-Teaching](/assets/images/soundness.jpg)

### 1. Apostolic Age Followers of ‚ÄúThe Way‚Äù (·º° ·ΩÅŒ¥œåœÇ - hƒó hod√≥s) & Ante-Nicene Period Christianity (ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ)

This is systemless Christianity directly from Christ and the Apostles. The terms **·º° ·ΩÅŒ¥œåœÇ (hƒì hod√≥s)** and **ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ (Christianismos)** refer to different periods and aspects of early Christianity:

1. **·º° ·ΩÅŒ¥œåœÇ (hƒì hod√≥s)** ‚Äì Followers of "The Way":
   - This term is associated with the **Apostolic Age**, which is the period during the lifetime of the apostles, roughly from the time of Jesus' resurrection (c. AD 30) to the death of the last apostle, John (c. AD 100). It was used to describe the early Christian movement in its initial stages.
   - Example: Acts 9:2, where Saul (later Paul) sought to persecute followers of "The Way."
   - See also: Acts 9:2 (c. AD 34-36); Acts 19:9 (c. AD 54-56); Acts 19:23 (c. AD 54-56); Acts 22:4 (c. AD 57); Acts 24:14 (c. AD 57); Acts 24:22 (c. AD 57)

2. **ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ (Christianismos)** ‚Äì Christianity:
   - This term, and the related term **ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ (Christianos)** meaning "Christian," became more common in the **Ante-Nicene Period**, which extends from the end of the Apostolic Age (c. AD 100) to the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325. By this time, the term "Christian" had become widely accepted as the standard designation for followers of Jesus Christ.
   - Example: Acts 11:26, where the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
   - See also: Acts 11:26 (c. AD 47-48); Acts 26:28 (c. AD 59-60); 1 Peter 4:16 (c. AD 64-65).

In summary, **·º° ·ΩÅŒ¥œåœÇ (hƒì hod√≥s)** is primarily associated with the Apostolic Age, while **ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ (Christianismos)** is more associated with the Ante-Nicene Period. Consider my articles on being a systemless moderate and basic protestant.

- [The Hierarchy of Authority & How To Be A Good Berean](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/).

### 2. Moderate Protestant *&lsquo;isms*

There's very few groups that fall into this uniquely accurate section, among them are: [Amyraldism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/), Reformed Arminianism (Reformed Wesleyanism), C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity, and the [original Calvary Chapel distinctives](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/calvary-chapel/). These all define moderate protestant positions.

- [Protestants are the most educated group in existence](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/science/) with support from the academic community.
- Sound doctrine & adherence to the [five solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg).
- Sound teachings on faith as notitia (&lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;), assensus (&lsquo;agreement&rsquo;), and fiducia (&lsquo;trust & reliance&rsquo;); as well as, [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) as a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ.
- Early reformed confessions such as the [Heidelberg Catechism (1563)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/heidelberg-catechism/), or [Amyraldian (moderately reformed)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/) confessions such as [New Hampshire Confession (1833)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/new-hampshire-confession-1833/). They do not push [limited atonement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/), or extreme views.

<!-- ### 3. Ancient Catholic Orthodoxy (Trinity & Jesus Deity)
- Like that of the Early Church Fathers.
- Sound teachings on [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) & faith.
- See <a href="#Legalism">Heretical Sects (Legalism)</a> section for Roman Catholicism. -->

<a name="Overview-Section-Two" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üìú VI. Overview of Scriptural Teachings</a>

### ‚úÖ Correct teachings from scripture are as follows:

- The Bible is against the heresy of legalism, but supports Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor of resulting obedience to God.
    - Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
    - True Christians love God by obeying him (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Obedience does not merit salvation, the Holy Spirit produces obedience (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5, Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
    - Faith is not a work (Romans 4:5), and repentance is a fruit (Mt 3:8-10 NLT).
- Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith.
    - Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
    - Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
    - The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- The Bible is against the heresy of antinomianism.
    - We are set free from sin, but not set free to sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Everyone has sin (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).
    - We are no longer under the law (Ro 6:1-2,14-15; Gal 3:23-25; Gal 5:18; Col 2:14), but we still uphold the law (Romans 3:31).
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (**Mt 10:38 NLT**; Mt 16:24; **Lk 9:23** Lk 9:62; **Lk 14:27**; Mk 8:34... Jn 15:8 ESV; Mt 3:10; 25:30).

<a name="Warnings-From-The-Apostles" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üìú VII. Warnings From The Apostles</a>

Because I already addressed [the heresy of antinomianism](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html) multiple times, I'm going to briefly cover the topic here:

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But false prophets arose among the people, just as <span style="font-weight:bold;">there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">even to the point of denying the <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Master</span> who bought them</span>. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">many will follow their <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">[debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles</span></span>. Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. &mdash; [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET)

1. **The Apostle Peter** reveals that false teachers would infiltrate the church, lead many into [debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles, slandering the way of truth with their destructive heresies. In 2 Peter 2 he describes them as, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed&rdquo;*</span> (v. 12), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;springs without water and mists driven by a storm&rdquo;*</span> (v. 17), and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;slaves of depravity&rdquo;*</span> (v. 19). These statements showcase that the subjects were unregenerate professors of the faith.
2. **The Apostle John<sup>[[1]](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/) [[2]](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/)</sup>** completely obliterates antinomianism in 1 Jn 2:3-6 when he says, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.&rdquo;*</span> He later states, in 1 John 3:7-9, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Little children, let no one deceive you. ... Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, ... No one born of God makes a practice of sinning ...&rdquo;*</span> proving, without a shadow of a doubt, that a true born again has undergone regeneration by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. They no longer &ldquo;*practice*&rdquo; and pursue lifestyles of sin.
3. **The Apostle Jude** in Jd 4 NET calls the church to defend the truth aggressively against this infiltration of dualistic antinomianism when he says, *&ldquo;For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">ungodly men who have turned the grace of our God into a license for evil</span> and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;*
4. **The Apostle Paul** conquers this extremism in Romans 6:1-2,15 when he says, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">&ldquo;What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Absolutely not!</span>&rdquo;</span> Paul also debunks [dispensational antinomianism](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html) when he says, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">&ldquo;Do we then nullify the law through faith? <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Absolutely not!</span> Instead we uphold the law.&rdquo;</span> (Rom 3:31 NET; 1 Cor 6:9‚Äì11; 9:21).

**The Apostle Paul** thoroughly warned New Testament Christians (You & Me). **These warnings were written to people** who would be listening to the New Testament epistles as they were read aloud **in New Testament Churches** (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11; 2 Cor. 13:5; Heb. 3:12; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 3:6, 9-10; 14).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, depravity, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish rivalries, dissensions, factions, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> envying, murder, drunkenness, carousing, and similar things. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:goldenrod;">I am <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#e6b800;">warning</span> you, as I had warned you before:</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Those who <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">practice</span> such things <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">will not</span> inherit the kingdom of God!</span> &mdash; Galatians 5:19-21 NET

Practice in this sense means a lifelong continual pattern. It speaks of the pursuit of a lifestyle of indulgent sin. This does not mean that you will not have sin or that you will be perfect, in fact you may struggle with sin, make mistakes, and even backslide. A true Christian will undergo decreasing patterns of sin (1 John 3:8‚Äì9; cf. Rom. 6:14‚Äì18) in their progressive sanctification. They will not remain in their old way of life (2 Cor. 5:17; 1Jn 3:31).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Do you not know that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">the unrighteous <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">will not</span> inherit the kingdom of God</span>? Do not be deceived! The sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, passive homosexual partners, practicing homosexuals, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> thieves, the greedy, drunkards, the verbally abusive, and swindlers will not inherit the kingdom of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> Some of you <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:#009933;">once lived</span> this way. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. &mdash; 1 Cor. 6:9-11 NET

The Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

> Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith. &mdash; 2 Cor. 13:5 NLT

Finally, I would like you all to ruminate and hang on every word from the Apostle John.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Little children, let no one deceive you.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil</span>, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">No one born of God makes a practice of sinning</span>, for God's seed abides in him; and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">he cannot keep on sinning</span>, because he has been born of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">By this it is evident</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">who are the children of God</span>, and <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:Red;">who are the children of the devil</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God</span>, nor is the one who does not love his brother. &mdash; 1 John 3:6-10 ESV

<a name="Conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">ü©ª VIII. This ministry holds to a Systemless Moderate & Basic Protestant View</a>

I pray that those lost in the many cults and sects will make Christ their teacher once again, as the Bible says, [*&ldquo;Call no man your teacher&rdquo;*](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/). A true teacher does not teach man-made things (i.e. **Calvin**ism, **Arminian**ism, [**Chafer**anism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)). The verse where Paul advises against labeling ourselves after specific leaders is found in 1 Corinthians 1:12-13:

> "What I mean is that each one of you says, ‚ÄúI follow Paul,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Apollos,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Cephas,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Christ.‚Äù Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?"

Paul's point here is to emphasize unity in Christ rather than division by allegiance to specific human leaders, systems, *&lsquo;isms*, sects, cults, etc. Below I've listed the very best and most vetted and highly recommended orthodox stances you should take.

1. Basic Protestant ([five solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg))
2. Theologically Conservative
3. Moderate Distinctives ([systemless](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/))
4. [Compatibilist](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#carson) view of free will
5. Eschatological Premillennialist
6. Soft-cessationist

<!-- Long ago in my early twenties, I remember debating two mormon elders at my dining room table. The content that Dr. Walter Martin provided me completely decimated them in debate on approximately 20 points. I was calm, kind, and well mannered throughout the process.


> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> And the Lord‚Äôs slave [*servant or bondservant*] must not engage in heated disputes[*‚Äúmust not fight‚Äù or ‚Äúmust not quarrel.‚Äù*] but be kind toward all, an apt teacher, patient, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:24-25 NET

Before the debate, I remember them both getting on their hands and knees on the dining room floor and praying in vain before their defeat.

> We know that God does not listen to [sinners](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/), but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to this one. &mdash; John 9:31 LEB (cf. Proverbs 15:29; Isaiah 1:15)

I remember thinking to myself, I wonder how foolish they look to God, or if he's indifferent to what they are doing on the floor right now, maybe he's offended? What worth are the prayers of those with [a false gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+1%3A6-9%3B+2+Corinthians+11%3A13-15&version=ESV;NET;NLT) I asked myself.

> God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.‚Äù &mdash; John 4:24 ESV (This emphasizes the importance of worshiping and praying in accordance with the truth)

One thing is for certain, their *&ldquo;prayers&rdquo;* fell on deaf ears as they were defeated by the truth. Something necessary for them to endure if they were to accept sound doctrine.

> For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own [desires](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/#fruit), they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear [new things](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/). 4 And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths. &mdash; 2 Timothy 4:3-4 NET

I feel similarly about those deceived by the diminished gospel of the [80s Chaferanism sect](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), as well as those lost in the false gospel of the [Jehovah Witnesses cult (Watchtowerites)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/cults/). They *&ldquo;pray&rdquo;* in vain and obsessively with these false teachers and their false systems and organizations on a daily basis and will use every opportunity to push them on you until you have to [avoid them](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/cutting-ties/).

> But false prophets arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies, **even to the point of denying the Master who bought them**. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. 2 And many will follow their [debauched lifestyles](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched). Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. 3 And in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation pronounced long ago [cf. Jd 4 NET] is not sitting idly by; their destruction is not asleep. &mdash; 2 Peter 2:1-3 NET (cf. Matthew 7:15-16; 2 Timothy 3:13)

I pray they will make Christ their teacher once again. As the Bible says, [*&ldquo;Call no man your teacher&rdquo;*](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/). A true teacher does not teach man-made things (i.e. **Calvin**ism, **Arminian**ism, [**Chafer**anism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)). The verse where Paul advises against labeling ourselves after specific leaders is found in 1 Corinthians 1:12-13. It states:

> "What I mean is that each one of you says, ‚ÄúI follow Paul,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Apollos,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Cephas,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Christ.‚Äù 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (ESV)

Paul's point here is to emphasize unity in Christ rather than division by allegiance to specific human leaders. The *'isms* of the faith should be considered sects of Protestantism, but not heretical sects. Protestantism is the most sound group in existence. It's the baseline by which all others are measured, apart from [scripture itself](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/). Organizations like the Mormons & Witnesses should be considered either [heretical sects (theological cults)](https://youtu.be/j0QI52C7cjE?si=65PpGDWN18DftIkb). -->
