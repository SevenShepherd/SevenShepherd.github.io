<a name="Characteristics" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">‚ò†Ô∏è I. Characteristics of a Cult</a>

Some of the items in this list alone are not enough to classify a group as a cult, but when put together, if a group fits all or nearly all of the elements in this list, then it would be legitimate to classify them that way.

1. The group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous unquestioning commitment.
2. The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.
3. The group is preoccupied with making money.
4. Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
5. Mind-numbing techniques, [such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, debilitating work routines], are used to suppress doubts about the group or its leader
6. the leadership dictates sometimes, in great detail, how members should think act and feel [for example members must get permission from leaders to date, change jobs, get married; leaders may prescribe what type of clothes to wear, where to live, how to discipline children
and so forth].
7. The group is elitist, claiming a special exalted status for itself, its leaders and members [for example: the leader is considered the
messiah, or an avatar; the group and/or the leader has a special mission to save humanity].
8. The group has a polarized
us versus them mentality which causes conflict with the wider society.
9. The group's leader is not accountable to any authorities [as are for example military commanders and ministers priests monks and rabbis of mainstream denominations]. The group teaches or implies that supposedly exalted ends justify means that members would have considered unethical before joining the group [for example collecting money for bogus
charities].
10. The leadership induces feeling
of guilt in members in order to control
them
11. Members subservience to the
group causes them to cut ties with
family friends and personal group goals and
activities that were of interest before
joining the group
12. Members are expected to devote
inordinate amounts of time to the group
13. Members are encouraged or required to live and or socialize only with other group members.

<a name="Antinomianism" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 Heretical Sects (Antinomianism)</a>

![Antinomianism](/assets/images/antinomianism.jpg)

<a name="Overview-Section-Two" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.3 Overview of Scriptural Teachings</a>

‚úÖ Correct teachings from scripture are as follows:

- The Bible is against the heresy of legalism, but supports Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor of resulting obedience to God.
    - Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
    - True Christians love God by obeying him (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Obedience does not merit salvation, the Holy Spirit produces obedience (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5, Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
    - Faith is not a work (Romans 4:5), and repentance is a fruit (Mt 3:8-10 NLT).
- Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith.
    - Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
    - Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
    - The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- The Bible is against the heresy of antinomianism.
    - We are set free from sin, but not set free to sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).
    - We are no longer under the law (Ro 6:1-2,14-15; Gal 3:23-25; Gal 5:18; Col 2:14), but we still uphold the law (Romans 3:31).
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (**Mt 10:38 NLT**; Mt 16:24; **Lk 9:23** Lk 9:62; **Lk 14:27**; Mk 8:34... Jn 15:8 ESV; Mt 3:10; 25:30).

<!-- 
### 1. **Docetism**
- **Notoriety**: Falsely believed that Jesus' physical body was an illusion and that He did not truly suffer on the cross.
- **Impact**: Faced strong opposition from early church fathers, including Ignatius of Antioch, and was condemned as heretical.

### 3. Hyper-Grace Movement

- **Origins**: Late 20th century, within various charismatic and evangelical circles.
- **Key Beliefs**: Emphasis on God's grace to the exclusion of moral law and repentance, often perceived as antinomian heresy.
- **Classification**: Considered a heretical sect by mainstream Christianity for downplaying the importance of moral law (Ro 3:31; 6:1-2,15).

### 6. **Marcionism**
- **Leader**: Marcion
- **Notoriety**: Rejected the Old Testament and taught that the God of the Old Testament was different from the God of the New Testament.
- **Impact**: Marcionism prompted early Christians to formalize the New Testament canon. It was condemned by the early church.

### 9. **Montanism**
- **Leaders**: Montanus, Priscilla, Maximilla
- **Notoriety**: Claimed new prophetic revelations that superseded the teachings of the apostles.
- **Impact**: Early church condemned it for its radical views and practices, though it persisted for several centuries.

### 4. **Gnosticism**
- **Notoriety**: Emphasized secret knowledge (gnosis) for salvation and often denied the material world's goodness. Gnostic texts presented an alternative narrative to orthodox Christianity.
- **Impact**: Gnosticism presented a major theological challenge to early Christianity and was condemned by many early church fathers. -->

<a name="Conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">ü©ª VI. Why those lost in cults, heretical sects, and sects always push materials, other than the Bible or lexicons, to indoctrinate you.</a>

Long ago in my early twenties, I remember debating two mormon elders at my dining room table. The content that Dr. Walter Martin provided me completely decimated them in debate on approximately 20 points. I was calm, kind, and well mannered throughout the process.

<!-- in his book *&ldquo;The Kingdom of the Cults&rdquo;*  -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> And the Lord‚Äôs slave [*servant or bondservant*] must not engage in heated disputes[*‚Äúmust not fight‚Äù or ‚Äúmust not quarrel.‚Äù*] but be kind toward all, an apt teacher, patient, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:24-25 NET

Before the debate, I remember them both getting on their hands and knees on the dining room floor and praying in vain before their defeat.

> We know that God does not listen to [sinners](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/), but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to this one. &mdash; John 9:31 LEB (cf. Proverbs 15:29; Isaiah 1:15)

I remember thinking to myself, I wonder how foolish they look to God, or if he's indifferent to what they are doing on the floor right now, maybe he's offended? What worth are the prayers of those with [a false gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+1%3A6-9%3B+2+Corinthians+11%3A13-15&version=ESV;NET;NLT) I asked myself.

> God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.‚Äù &mdash; John 4:24 ESV (This emphasizes the importance of worshiping and praying in accordance with the truth)

One thing is for certain, their *&ldquo;prayers&rdquo;* fell on deaf ears as they were defeated by the truth. Something necessary for them to endure if they were to accept sound doctrine.

> For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own [desires](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/#fruit), they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear [new things](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/). 4 And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths. &mdash; 2 Timothy 4:3-4 NET

I feel similarly about those deceived by the diminished gospel of the [80s Chaferanism sect](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), as well as those lost in the false gospel of the [Jehovah Witnesses cult (Watchtowerites)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/cults/). They *&ldquo;pray&rdquo;* in vain and obsessively with these false teachers and their false systems and organizations on a daily basis and will use every opportunity to push them on you until you have to [avoid them](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/cutting-ties/).

> But false prophets arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies, **even to the point of denying the Master who bought them**. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. 2 And many will follow their [debauched lifestyles](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched). Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. 3 And in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation pronounced long ago [cf. Jd 4 NET] is not sitting idly by; their destruction is not asleep. &mdash; 2 Peter 2:1-3 NET (cf. Matthew 7:15-16; 2 Timothy 3:13)

I pray they will make Christ their teacher once again. As the Bible says, [*&ldquo;Call no man your teacher&rdquo;*](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/). A true teacher does not teach man-made things (i.e. **Calvin**ism, **Arminian**ism, [**Chafer**anism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)). The verse where Paul advises against labeling ourselves after specific leaders is found in 1 Corinthians 1:12-13. It states:

> "What I mean is that each one of you says, ‚ÄúI follow Paul,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Apollos,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Cephas,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Christ.‚Äù 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (ESV)

Paul's point here is to emphasize unity in Christ rather than division by allegiance to specific human leaders. The *'isms* of the faith should be considered sects of Protestantism, but not heretical sects. Protestantism is the most sound group in existence. It's the baseline by which all others are measured, apart from [scripture itself](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/). Organizations like the Mormons & Witnesses should be considered either [heretical sects or cults](https://youtu.be/j0QI52C7cjE?si=65PpGDWN18DftIkb).
