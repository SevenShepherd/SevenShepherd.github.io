<a name="Characteristics" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">‚ò†Ô∏è I. Characteristics of a Cult</a>

Some of the items in this list alone are not enough to classify a group as a cult, but when put together, if a group fits all or nearly all of the elements in this list, then it would be legitimate to classify them that way.

1. The group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous unquestioning commitment.
2. The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.
3. The group is preoccupied with making money.
4. Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
5. Mind-numbing techniques, [such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, debilitating work routines], are used to suppress doubts about the group or its leader
6. the leadership dictates sometimes, in great detail, how members should think act and feel [for example members must get permission from leaders to date, change jobs, get married; leaders may prescribe what type of clothes to wear, where to live, how to discipline children
and so forth].
7. The group is elitist, claiming a special exalted status for itself, its leaders and members [for example: the leader is considered the
messiah, or an avatar; the group and/or the leader has a special mission to save humanity].
8. The group has a polarized
us versus them mentality which causes conflict with the wider society.
9. The group's leader is not accountable to any authorities [as are for example military commanders and ministers priests monks and rabbis of mainstream denominations]. The group teaches or implies that supposedly exalted ends justify means that members would have considered unethical before joining the group [for example collecting money for bogus
charities].
10. The leadership induces feeling
of guilt in members in order to control
them
11. Members subservience to the
group causes them to cut ties with
family friends and personal group goals and
activities that were of interest before
joining the group
12. Members are expected to devote
inordinate amounts of time to the group
13. Members are encouraged or required to live and or socialize only with other group members.

- **Persistence**: How long the sect's beliefs continued to influence or challenge mainstream Christianity. -->



<a name="Legalism" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.1 Heretical Sects (Legalism)</a>

![Legalism](/assets/images/legalist-meme.jpg)

### 1. [*&ldquo;Jehovah's&rdquo;* Witnesses (Watchtowerites)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/cults/)

However, when the surviving fragments were re-examined by Egyptologists in the 20th century, they were identified as standard Egyptian funerary texts, including the "Book of Breathing" and the "Book of the Dead." These findings completely debunked the Latter-day Saint community.

> Under construction

### 3. Moderate & Extreme 80's &ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo; Movements (Chaferanism)
- **Founded**: Systematized in the 1980s.
- **Notoriety (Extreme)**: The thing that sets apart the extreme variant from the moderate, would be [antinomian carnal Christianity](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/#fruit). These are likely the false teachers the Apostle Peter warned us about in 2 Peter 2:1-2,12,17,19 NET. This extreme variant may need to be elevated from sect to theological cult (heretical sect). 
- **Notoriety (Moderate)**: False teachings on faith and [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/), erroneously teaching both of them to be assent, when instead faith is not only the assent of our minds but trust & reliance on Christ, and repentance is a remorse & conversion.
- They would not receive corrections from the academic community and 1,000's of Biblical Language Scholars. This group has the makings of a theological cult, and it's more extreme variant is likely one.
- See section on non-heretical <a href="#List-Of-Sects">sects</a> for the moderate variant and for [several other unscriptural teachings](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/).

> Christian theologians have never seen faith simply in terms of intellectual assent to Christian belief. It is a matter of the heart, not simply the mind, involving personal commitment. As the English theologian William Temple (1881‚Äì1944) once pointed out: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">‚ÄúFaith is not only the assent of our minds to doctrinal propositions: it is the commitment of our whole selves into the hands of a faithful Creator and merciful Redeemer.‚Äù</span> ...
>
> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Faith is about trust in God, rather than just accepting that God exists.</span>

> Many understand *repentance* to mean simply a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; The weakness of this position is that, for the New Testament, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">this meaning finds no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation</span>, none of which translate metano√©≈ç and met√°noia as &ldquo;*change of mind*&rdquo; for New Testament passages. <span style="font-style:italic;color:ForestGreen;">It is a definition [unique to Free Grace supporters](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference works</span>. It also lacks support from any English translation of the Bible.

### 2. KJV Onlyism
- Reasons: turns a blind eye to biblical language scholarship. Worships the creation rather than the creator. In denial of Daniel 12:4 which states that knowledge will be increased. Logically our English translations will increase in [accuracy](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/) as well.
- > "**99.8% of textual variants affect nothing**, most are spelling differences. there's different ways to spell John, there's different ways to spell Mary, they're not going to affect anything, but **the one-fifth of 1% that do affect things are the ones that scholars talk about**. The bottom line is it does not matter in some respects which New Testament you use because **no essential doctrine is jeopardized** by any of these textual variants" &mdash; [Professor Daniel B. Wallace, Ph.D.](https://youtu.be/NikVdhp0YFs)

### 3. Hyper-Calvinism
- Reasons: Anti-evangelistic, limited atonement.

### 4. Orthodox Calvinism
- Reasons: Limited atonement.
- See <a href="#Orthodoxy">Orthodox Christian Groups</a> for Amyraldism (Moderate Calvinism).

![Sound-Teaching](/assets/images/soundness.jpg)

### 1. Protestantism
- [Most educated group in existence](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/science/) with support from the academic community.
- Sound doctrine & adherenence to the [five solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg).
- Sound teachings on faith as notitia (&lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;), assensus (&lsquo;agreement&rsquo;), and fiducia (&lsquo;trust & reliance&rsquo;); as well as, [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) as a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ.

### 2. [Systemless Moderates](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/) & Moderate Protestant *&lsquo;isms*
- [Amyraldism (Moderate Calvinism)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/), [Original Calvary Chapel Distinctives](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/calvary-chapel/), Possibly Reformed Arminianism (Reformed Wesleyanism). They hold to unlimited atonement or hypothetical universalism.
- Early or moderately reformed or amyraldian confessions that do not push [limited atonement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/), or extreme views, such as the [New Hampshire Confession (1833)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/new-hampshire-confession-1833/), or even the [Heidelberg Catechism (1563)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/heidelberg-catechism/).

### 3. Ancient Catholic Orthodoxy (Trinity & Jesus Deity)
- Like that of the Early Church Fathers.
- Sound teachings on [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) & faith.
- See <a href="#Legalism">Heretical Sects (Legalism)</a> section for Roman Catholicism.

<a name="Overview-Section-Two" href="#contents" style="font-size:2,1em;">üìú VI. Overview of Scriptural Teachings</a>

### ‚úÖ Correct teachings from scripture are as follows:

- The Bible is against the heresy of legalism, but supports Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor of resulting obedience to God.
    - Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
    - True Christians love God by obeying him (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Obedience does not merit salvation, the Holy Spirit produces obedience (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5, Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
    - Faith is not a work (Romans 4:5), and repentance is a fruit (Mt 3:8-10 NLT).
- Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith.
    - Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
    - Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
    - The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- The Bible is against the heresy of antinomianism.
    - We are set free from sin, but not set free to sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).
    - We are no longer under the law (Ro 6:1-2,14-15; Gal 3:23-25; Gal 5:18; Col 2:14), but we still uphold the law (Romans 3:31).
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (**Mt 10:38 NLT**; Mt 16:24; **Lk 9:23** Lk 9:62; **Lk 14:27**; Mk 8:34... Jn 15:8 ESV; Mt 3:10; 25:30).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings from the Apostles

Because I already addressed [the heresy of antinomianism](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html) multiple times, I'm going to briefly cover the topic here:

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But false prophets arose among the people, just as <span style="font-weight:bold;">there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">even to the point of denying the <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Master</span> who bought them</span>. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">many will follow their <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">[debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles</span></span>. Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. &mdash; [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET)

1. **The Apostle Peter** reveals that false teachers would infiltrate the church, lead many into [debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles, slandering the way of truth with their destructive heresies. In 2 Peter 2 he describes them as, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed&rdquo;*</span> (v. 12), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;springs without water and mists driven by a storm&rdquo;*</span> (v. 17), and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;slaves of depravity&rdquo;*</span> (v. 19). These statements showcase that the subjects were unregenerate professors of the faith.
2. **The Apostle John<sup>[[1]](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/) [[2]](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/)</sup>** completely obliterates antinomianism in 1 Jn 2:3-6 when he says, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.&rdquo;*</span> He later states, in 1 John 3:7-9, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Little children, let no one deceive you. ... Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, ... No one born of God makes a practice of sinning ...&rdquo;*</span> proving, without a shadow of a doubt, that a true born again has undergone regeneration by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. They no longer &ldquo;*practice*&rdquo; and pursue lifestyles of sin.
3. **The Apostle Jude** in Jd 4 NET calls the church to defend the truth aggressively against this infiltration of dualistic antinomianism when he says, *&ldquo;For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">ungodly men who have turned the grace of our God into a license for evil</span> and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;*
4. **The Apostle Paul** conquers this extremism in Romans 6:1-2,15 when he says, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">&ldquo;What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Absolutely not!</span>&rdquo;</span> Paul also debunks [dispensational antinomianism](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html) when he says, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">&ldquo;Do we then nullify the law through faith? <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Absolutely not!</span> Instead we uphold the law.&rdquo;</span> (Rom 3:31 NET; 1 Cor 6:9‚Äì11; 9:21).

**The Apostle Paul** thoroughly warned New Testament Christians (You & Me). **These warnings were written to people** who would be listening to the New Testament epistles as they were read aloud **in New Testament Churches** (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11; 2 Cor. 13:5; Heb. 3:12; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 3:6, 9-10; 14).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, depravity, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish rivalries, dissensions, factions, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> envying, murder, drunkenness, carousing, and similar things. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:goldenrod;">I am <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#e6b800;">warning</span> you, as I had warned you before:</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Those who <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">practice</span> such things <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">will not</span> inherit the kingdom of God!</span> &mdash; Galatians 5:19-21 NET

Practice in this sense means a lifelong continual pattern. It speaks of the pursuit of a lifestyle of indulgent sin. This does not mean that you will not have sin or that you will be perfect, in fact you may struggle with sin, make mistakes, and even backslide. A true Christian will undergo decreasing patterns of sin (1 John 3:8‚Äì9; cf. Rom. 6:14‚Äì18) in their progressive sanctification. They will not remain in their old way of life (2 Cor. 5:17; 1Jn 3:31).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Do you not know that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">the unrighteous <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">will not</span> inherit the kingdom of God</span>? Do not be deceived! The sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, passive homosexual partners, practicing homosexuals, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> thieves, the greedy, drunkards, the verbally abusive, and swindlers will not inherit the kingdom of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> Some of you <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:#009933;">once lived</span> this way. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. &mdash; 1 Cor. 6:9-11 NET

The Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

> Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith. &mdash; 2 Cor. 13:5 NLT

Finally, I would like you all to ruminate and hang on every word from the Apostle John.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Little children, let no one deceive you.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil</span>, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">No one born of God makes a practice of sinning</span>, for God's seed abides in him; and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">he cannot keep on sinning</span>, because he has been born of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">By this it is evident</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">who are the children of God</span>, and <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:Red;">who are the children of the devil</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God</span>, nor is the one who does not love his brother. &mdash; 1 John 3:6-10 ESV

<a name="Conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">ü©ª VII. Why those lost in cults, heretical sects, and sects always push materials, other than the Bible or lexicons, to indoctrinate you.</a>

Long ago in my early twenties, I remember debating two mormon elders at my dining room table. The content that Dr. Walter Martin provided me completely decimated them in debate on approximately 20 points. I was calm, kind, and well mannered throughout the process.

<!-- in his book *&ldquo;The Kingdom of the Cults&rdquo;*  -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> And the Lord‚Äôs slave [*servant or bondservant*] must not engage in heated disputes[*‚Äúmust not fight‚Äù or ‚Äúmust not quarrel.‚Äù*] but be kind toward all, an apt teacher, patient, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:24-25 NET

Before the debate, I remember them both getting on their hands and knees on the dining room floor and praying in vain before their defeat.

> We know that God does not listen to [sinners](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/), but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to this one. &mdash; John 9:31 LEB (cf. Proverbs 15:29; Isaiah 1:15)

I remember thinking to myself, I wonder how foolish they look to God, or if he's indifferent to what they are doing on the floor right now, maybe he's offended? What worth are the prayers of those with [a false gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+1%3A6-9%3B+2+Corinthians+11%3A13-15&version=ESV;NET;NLT) I asked myself.

> God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.‚Äù &mdash; John 4:24 ESV (This emphasizes the importance of worshiping and praying in accordance with the truth)

One thing is for certain, their *&ldquo;prayers&rdquo;* fell on deaf ears as they were defeated by the truth. Something necessary for them to endure if they were to accept sound doctrine.

> For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own [desires](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/#fruit), they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear [new things](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/). 4 And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths. &mdash; 2 Timothy 4:3-4 NET

I feel similarly about those deceived by the diminished gospel of the [80s Chaferanism sect](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), as well as those lost in the false gospel of the [Jehovah Witnesses cult (Watchtowerites)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/cults/). They *&ldquo;pray&rdquo;* in vain and obsessively with these false teachers and their false systems and organizations on a daily basis and will use every opportunity to push them on you until you have to [avoid them](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/cutting-ties/).

> But false prophets arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies, **even to the point of denying the Master who bought them**. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. 2 And many will follow their [debauched lifestyles](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched). Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. 3 And in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation pronounced long ago [cf. Jd 4 NET] is not sitting idly by; their destruction is not asleep. &mdash; 2 Peter 2:1-3 NET (cf. Matthew 7:15-16; 2 Timothy 3:13)

I pray they will make Christ their teacher once again. As the Bible says, [*&ldquo;Call no man your teacher&rdquo;*](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/). A true teacher does not teach man-made things (i.e. **Calvin**ism, **Arminian**ism, [**Chafer**anism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)). The verse where Paul advises against labeling ourselves after specific leaders is found in 1 Corinthians 1:12-13. It states:

> "What I mean is that each one of you says, ‚ÄúI follow Paul,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Apollos,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Cephas,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Christ.‚Äù 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (ESV)

Paul's point here is to emphasize unity in Christ rather than division by allegiance to specific human leaders. The *'isms* of the faith should be considered sects of Protestantism, but not heretical sects. Protestantism is the most sound group in existence. It's the baseline by which all others are measured, apart from [scripture itself](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/). Organizations like the Mormons & Witnesses should be considered either [heretical sects or cults](https://youtu.be/j0QI52C7cjE?si=65PpGDWN18DftIkb).
