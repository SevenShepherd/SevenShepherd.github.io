⚠️ Under construction - Since I just critiqued [the 80s &ldquo;*free grace*&rdquo; movement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), I thought it would only be fair if I did the same with lordship salvation. Refresh article weekly for updates.

> A false balance is an abomination to the Lord, but a just weight is his delight. &mdash; Proverbs 11:1

<!-- ℹ️ Disclaimer: As a protestant who holds to the [five solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg), I believe justification is by grace through faith alone, we developed it from scripture first in history. I also believe that grace is free just like all true Christians do, but this 80s movement brings with it a dangerous set of unbiblical doctrines.
