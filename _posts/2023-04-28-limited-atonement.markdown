Reformed theology (orthodox Calvinism) has a minority moderate stance, colloquially known as moderate Calvinism. This stance takes issue with limited atonement and favors a libertarian view of free will, instead of a [freedom of inclination](https://youtu.be/kSgYJbXGb04?t=55) view of free will. I can think of no one better to defend and delineate this stance than Dr. Ron Rhodes.

That we have the will which is a faculty of choosing, and in the fall as desperate as the fall is and as corrupt as we become, we don't stop willing. We sin because we want to sin. And that's why we are exposed to the punishment of God, because we are willful in our sin and we are willful in our rejection of God. [Dr. R. C.
