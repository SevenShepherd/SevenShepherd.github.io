<!-- Reformed theology (orthodox Calvinism) has a minority moderate stance, colloquially known as moderate Calvinism. This stance takes issue with limited atonement and favors a libertarian view of free will, instead of a [freedom of inclination](https://youtu.be/kSgYJbXGb04?t=55) view of free will. I can think of no one better to defend and delineate this position than Dr. Ron Rhodes. -->

Reformed theology, or orthodox Calvinism, posits a minority moderate position, often referred to as moderate Calvinism. This nuanced perspective deviates from the conventional doctrine of limited atonement and instead favors a libertarian conception of free will, as opposed to the prevailing view of [freedom of inclination](https://youtu.be/kSgYJbXGb04?t=55). In this regard, there are few individuals better equipped than Dr. Ron Rhodes to articulate and defend this stance with precision and clarity.

> My position is known in theological circles as ‚Äú4-point Calvinism. ... As a 4-point Calvinist, I hold to all the above <span style="color:#A8A8A8">[TULIP]</span> except limited atonement <span style="color:#A8A8A8">['L']</span>. &mdash; [Dr. Ron Rhodes (Th.D., Dallas Theological Seminary)](https://youtu.be/Efc5MA2Vtu4), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#FBB917;">4-point Moderate Calvinist</span>, [The Extent of the Atonement‚ÄîLimited Atonement versus Unlimited Atonement](https://www.ronrhodes.org/the-extent-of-the-atonement).

<!-- This article will be focused on Limited vs Unlimited Atonement; however, I would like to represent free will correctly from a Calvinistic standpoint. So many people get this wrong. Charts are from Sproul's book [Chosen by God](https://amzn.to/42w1i9y) -->

The focal point of this article is a comparison between Limited and Unlimited Atonement; nonetheless, it is of utmost importance to accurately convey the Calvinistic perspective on free will. It has been observed that numerous individuals tend to misconstrue this notion. It is pertinent to note that the charts presented herein are derived from Sproul's authoritative work ["Chosen by God."](https://amzn.to/42w1i9y)

> Every person who's ever been a Calvinist that I know of in history, has affirmed without reservation, that we are moral agents. We are volitional creatures that God has made; each one of us with a mind, with a heart, with affections, and with a will. &mdash; [Dr. R. C. Sproul (Ph.D., Whitefield Theological Seminary)](https://youtu.be/kSgYJbXGb04?t=55), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">5-point Orthodox Calvinist</span>.

> Unless it <span style="color:#A8A8A8">[your will]</span> has no bias to either side it's not truly free. Calvinism teaches that your desires are only wicked continuously in your fallen condition. They <span style="color:#A8A8A8">[Arminians]</span> would say then "Well your will isn't free," I'd say "Well it's free from coercion, but what it's not free from is you," because when I choose something I choose what I want, and if what I want is corrupt, then my choice will be corrupt. That's why I have to be changed, inside of me, for my will to choose the things of God. &mdash; [Dr. R. C. Sproul (Ph.D., Whitefield Theological Seminary)](https://youtu.be/kSgYJbXGb04?t=209), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">5-point Orthodox Calvinist</span>.

That we have the will which is a faculty of choosing, and in the fall as desperate as the fall is and as corrupt as we become, we don't stop willing. We sin because we want to sin. And that's why we are exposed to the punishment of God, because we are willful in our sin and we are willful in our rejection of God. [Dr. R. C.
