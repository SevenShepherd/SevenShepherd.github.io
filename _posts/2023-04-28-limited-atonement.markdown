Instead of reiterating the points made by Dr. Ron Rhodes in his article &ldquo;[*The Extent of the Atonement,*](https://www.ronrhodes.org/the-extent-of-the-atonement)&rdquo; I would encourage you to read them yourself as the article is not very large.

> My position is known in theological circles as ‚Äú4-point Calvinism. ... As a 4-point Calvinist, I hold to all the above <span style="color:#A8A8A8">[TULIP]</span> except limited atonement <span style="color:#A8A8A8">['L']</span>. &mdash; [Dr. Ron Rhodes (Th.D., Dallas Theological Seminary)](https://youtu.be/Efc5MA2Vtu4), [The Extent of the Atonement](https://www.ronrhodes.org/the-extent-of-the-atonement).

Dr. John C. Lennox also contributes many vital points in his book &ldquo;[*Determined to Believe?*]()&rdquo; if you want something more in-depth and expansive.

> All of this invalidates the L of TULIP ‚Äì ‚Äúlimited atonement‚Äù ‚Äì
the view that Christ did not actually die for all but only for the ‚Äúelect‚Äù.
In fact, not only Luther but many of the other reformers, including
Calvin, did not subscribe to limited atonement... this view of the atonement
was not even introduced until the second or third generation of
Reformers... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*]() p. 179.

Consider the following points:
- The Bible does not support limited atonement:
    - 1 Jn 2:2; 4:14; Jn 1:9,29; 3:17; 4:42; 12:32; Ac 2:21; Ro 5:6; 1Ti 2:3-4,6; Titus 2:11; 2Cor 5:19; 2Pe 3:9.
- St. Augustine and virtually every other church father did not hold to limited atonement.
- Luther & John Calvin did not hold to limited atonement either.
- Jonathan Edwards was likely a hypothetical universalist.

<!-- "üå∑ ‚ÄúMy position is known in theological circles as ‚Äú4-point Calvinism.‚Äù‚Äù ‚Äî Dr. Ron Rhodes. Is He Correct To Drop The 'L' From TULIP?" -->

<!-- Reformed theology contains a majority position known as Scholastic Calvinism, and a minority view which posits a moderate position, often referred to as moderate Calvinism. This nuanced perspective deviates from the conventional doctrine of limited atonement and instead favors a libertarian conception of free will, as opposed to the prevailing view of [freedom of inclination](https://youtu.be/kSgYJbXGb04?t=55). In this regard, there are few individuals better equipped than Dr. Ron Rhodes to articulate and defend this stance with precision and clarity. -->

<!-- > Unless it <span style="color:#A8A8A8">[your will]</span> has no bias to either side it's not truly free. Calvinism teaches that your desires are only wicked continuously in your fallen condition. They <span style="color:#A8A8A8">[Arminians]</span> would say then "Well your will isn't free," I'd say "Well it's free from coercion, but what it's not free from is you," because when I choose something I choose what I want, and if what I want is corrupt, then my choice will be corrupt.

<!-- - <a name="John3:16" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">üå∏ 2.1 John 3:16</a>

    > ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">that <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">whoever believes</span></span> in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. &mdash; John 3:16 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible) -->

    Ron Rhodes seems to go in-depth about the Greek word for whole, but I think it is clear that no one from either side is contesting that. The real issue is how *"whoever believes"* is to be understood. Logically, we all agree that there is a group who makes it to heaven by God's grace, and a group which does not.

    It's clear that *"whoever believes"* is not the whole world, but a subset of people in the world. From this point onward, those within orthodoxy could easily say, that those who answer the effectual call are those who would believe, because they were predestined to and that is how God showed his love to the world, by saving a subset of people out of it.

    Rhodes points out correctly that the context shows, in vv. 14-15, that <span style="font-style:italic:bold;color:#828282;">&ldquo;John 3:16 cannot be divorced from verses 14-15, wherein Christ alludes to Numbers 21 with its discussion of Moses setting up the brazen serpent in the camp of Israel, so that if ‚Äúany man‚Äù looked to it, he experienced physical deliverance. In verse 15 Christ applies the story spiritually when He says that ‚Äúwhosoever‚Äù believes on the uplifted Son of Man shall experience spiritual deliverance.&rdquo;</span> &mdash; [Dr. Ron Rhodes (Th.D., Dallas Theological Seminary), The Extent of the Atonement](https://www.ronrhodes.org/the-extent-of-the-atonement), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#FBB917;">4-point Moderate Calvinist</span>.

    However, no one is debating that. We all believe this, the question is, is the subset of *"whoever believes"* doing so because they are elect? You might be saying to yourself, but he said *"any man,"* to which I would reply, of those who were not killed by poisonous serpents initially, before being given the chance to look upon the bronze serpent.

    > So Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people so that many people of Israel died. &mdash; Num. 21:6

    Furthermore, of those who survived, there were some who still did not repent even though the cure rate was 100%. Thus, &ldquo;any man&rdquo; is not &ldquo;every man&rdquo; by observation.

    > What is left unstated in this narrative is the number of people who died despite this remedy that God provided. Some of the people clearly repented, but the implication of the text is that **some of those who were bitten** looked at the bronze serpent while others **did not**. Even in their death agonies, in the throes of the terror and pain inflicted by these serpents, they would not trust God‚Äôs prescribed course‚Äî**even though the cure rate was one hundred percent**. &mdash; [Dr. R. C. Sproul (Ph.D., Whitefield Theological Seminary), John: An Expositional Commentary](https://amzn.to/42bfUdW), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">5-point Scholastic Calvinist</span>.
    
    All Christian theologies including Rhodes' acknowledges an effectual call. While I find Rhodes answer to be a good one, I don't find it to be convincing. I'd need something more to tip the scales of interpretation. I find this subject to be dangerous to get wrong so I'm not advocating for either position as of yet. -->
