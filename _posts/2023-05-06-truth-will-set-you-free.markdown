<span style="font-size:2.1em">The Truth Will Set You Free</span>

Truth jolts deniers, rouses the complacent, and confronts the unlearned; it is a thorn in the side of the ignorant and intellectually lazy.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> ‚ÄúDo not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you; Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.‚Äù &mdash; Proverbs 9:8-9

Truth is offensive to those who are not living in it. Truth aggravates the naive and simpleminded. Those who are not in the truth are irritated by it.

> Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. &mdash; Proverbs 23:9

The truth will set you free. Don't fight it.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">31</sup> Jesus said to the people who believed in him, ‚ÄúYou are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">32</sup> And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù &mdash; John 8:31-32
