<span style="font-size:2.1em">The Truth Will Set You Free</span>

Truth jolts deniers, rouses the complacent, and confronts the unlearned; it is a thorn in the side of the ignorant and intellectually lazy.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> ‚ÄúDo not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you; Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.‚Äù &mdash; Proverbs 9:8-9

Truth is offensive to those who are not living in it. Truth aggravates the naive and simpleminded. Those who are not in the truth are irritated by it.

> Do not speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words. &mdash; Proverbs 23:9 NET

Truth is a shock to the system of those who cling to ignorance and a slap in the face of the inexperienced. Truth breaks the shackles of the enslaved and the teeth of the arrogant.

> When they heard this, they ceased their objections and praised God, saying, ‚ÄúSo then, **God has granted the repentance that leads to life** even to the Gentiles.‚Äù &mdash; Acts 11:18

While this is all true, it is incumbent upon us to **teach the truth gently** so that God will grant them repentance. If they scoff and reject the truth just remember that they are unwise for this, and if they were truly interested in the truth they would have inquired more.

> correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps **God will grant them repentance** and then knowledge of the truth &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:25 NET

Some people would rather have soft nothings whispered into their ears by false teachers than hard truths by real ones.

> For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching. They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear. &mdash; 2 Timothy 4:3

<!-- This ministry has proven and provided evidence for it's every position no matter how hard the teaching. There will always be those who would rather win arguments than defend the truth. Move on to other people in need. -->

If they're trying to win instead of defend the truth, they will never know victory or truth. Sometimes we have to move on to those who will listen. Preach the gospel at all times, and if necessary, use words. In other words, sometimes you're the only bible anyone will ever read. Don't live a lie.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">31</sup> Jesus said to the people who believed in him, ‚ÄúYou are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">32</sup> And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù &mdash; John 8:31-32

The truth will set you free. Don't fight it.
