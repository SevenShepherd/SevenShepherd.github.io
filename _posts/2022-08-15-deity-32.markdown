- NET Bible Translator Notes
    
    > a. 1 Corinthians 1:1 NET tn Grk “Paul.” The word “From” is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.
    >
    b. 1 Corinthians 1:1 NET tc Many significant mss, as well as several others (א A Ψ 1739 1881 M sy), have a reversed order of these words and read “Jesus Christ” rather than “Christ Jesus” (P46 B D F G 33 it). The meaning is not affected in either case, but the reading “Christ Jesus” is preferred both because it has somewhat better attestation and because it is slightly more difficult and thus more likely the earlier reading (a scribe who found it would be prone to change it to the more common expression). At the same time, Paul is fond of the order “Christ Jesus.” As well, the later Pauline letters almost uniformly use this order in the salutations. Thus, on both external and internal grounds, “Christ Jesus” is the preferred reading here.

    c. 1 Corinthians 1:2 NET tn Grk “theirs and ours.”
