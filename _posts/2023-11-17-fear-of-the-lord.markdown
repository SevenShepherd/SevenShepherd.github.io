Imagine standing in front of the supreme being of the universe and foolishly thinking that you will not be terrified by his majesty and power as he looks through your soul like a pane glass window at every thought and secret you've ever had (Ro 2:16 NET; Ps 139:1-2 NLT; Jer 17:10 NLT).

> And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather **fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell**. &mdash; Matthew 10:28 ESV

As you lie there, wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked (Revelation 3:15-17), failing to escape the tremendous unapproachable light (1Tim. 6:16) radiating through your skull, you wonder to yourself how you could have ever been so foolish (Pr 1:7; 9:10; Ps 111:10), why you slandered, did drugs, hated, murdered, killed, fornicated, raped, molested (Gal 5:19-21; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5 … + Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32; Mt 7:21,23)... but did not turn back and repent of your sins against God (Lk 13:3; Ac 3:19).

> **The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom**, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.

Now you understand where that awe and reverence comes from. For Christians it's a healthy balance of love, reverence, respect and healthy fear. Imagine God sending an unidentified creature to swallow you, and you still can't see why you should fear God in every sense of the word. Jonah was a good example of how we should be, minus the disobedience.

<!-- > who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen. -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">9</sup> And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, <sup style="font-weight:bold">10</sup> **he also** will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold">11</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night</span>, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.” &mdash; Revelation 14:9-11 ESV

There is a lake which burns with fire and brimstone (Re 21:8); where the worm dies not and the fire is not quenched, and the smoke of the torment of those who end up their will ascend up for ever and ever (Mk 9:48; Rv. 14:11 KJV). Be sure that this isn't you.

> Some of you once lived this way. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. &mdash; 1 Corinthians 6:11 NET

<!-- (cf. 1Jn 1:7; Jn 3:17) -->

<!-- > And his affection for you is even greater, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how **you received him with fear and trembling**. -->

Atheism is the temporary delusion that you can sin against God without consequence. Only failing to repent and trust in God will lead you to this. Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand (Mt 4:17).

> The fool says **in his heart**, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, **they do** abominable deeds; there is none who does good. &mdash; Psalm 14:1 ESV (cf. Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9)

> No, I tell you; but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless you repent</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will</span> all likewise <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">perish</span>. &mdash; Luke 13:3 ESV

> Then he said, “I tell you the truth, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless you turn</span> from your sins and become like little children, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven</span>. &mdash; Matthew 18:3 NLT

> Christians who fear that they may have committed the unpardonable sin show by their very anxiety that they have not done so. Persons who have committed it are unremorseful and unconcerned; indeed, they are ordinarily unaware of what they have done and to what fate they have sentenced themselves. &mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford). 88. UNPARDONABLE SIN - **Only Impenitence Cannot Be Forgiven**. On [faith](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo), on [repentance](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8).
