<span style="font-family:monospace;font-style:Italic;font-size:40px;">Hypotheses non fingo</span>

> "**99.8% of textual variants affect nothing**, most are spelling differences. there's different ways to spell John, there's different ways to spell Mary, they're not going to affect anything, but **the one-fifth of 1% that do affect things are the ones that scholars talk about**. The bottom line is it does not matter in some respects which New Testament you use because **no essential doctrine is jeopardized** by any of these textual variants" &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor, Ph.D.](https://youtu.be/NikVdhp0YFs)

While it is true that no essential doctrine is jeopardized by any textual variants, I am reminded of Solomon's wise words in Ecclesiates:

> Using a dull ax requires great strength, so sharpen the blade. That’s the value of wisdom; it helps you succeed. &mdash; Ecclesiates 10:10 NLT (New Living Translation)

Here is the Lord's Prayer from The Message (MSG) Bible, which is only a paraphrase and not a translation; however, the phrase [*"as above, so below"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_above,_so_below) caught my eye. Suffice It to Say, I will be removing The Message from the line up.

> 7-13 “The world is full of so-called prayer warriors who are prayer-ignorant. They’re full of formulas and programs and advice, peddling techniques for getting what you want from God. Don’t fall for that nonsense. This is your Father you are dealing with, and he knows better than you what you need. With a God like this loving you, you can pray very simply. Like this:
>
> Our Father in heaven,<br>
Reveal who you are.<br>
Set the world right;<br>
Do what’s best—<br>
    **as above, so below**.<br>
Keep us alive with three square meals.<br>
Keep us forgiven with you and forgiving others.<br>
Keep us safe from ourselves and the Devil.<br>
You’re in charge!<br>
You can do anything you want!<br>
You’re ablaze in beauty!<br>
    Yes. Yes. Yes.

<span style="font-family:monospace;font-style:Italic;font-size:40px;">Behemoth or Hippopotamus?</span>

The Biblical description of the Behemoth can be found in Job 40:15-24 ([comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Job%2040:15)). As you can see from the comparison, very few versions get this wrong.

The absurdity of translating Behemoth as hippopotamus is highlighted below. How many hippopotamuses do you know with a tail like a cedar tree? This is obviously a prehistoric creature.

This is obviously a prehistoric creature. How many crocodiles do you know of that can breath fire? See the absurd translation of the NLV below.

<span style="font-family:monospace;font-style:Italic;font-size:40px;">Jehovah or Yahweh?</span>

<span style="font-family:monospace;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">The Mistransliteration 'Jehovah' Was Never Used By The Jews</span>

Jewish and Christian scholars, who are thoroughly familiar with the Old Testament Hebrew language and how to pronounce Hebrew words, make it clear that the Hebrew word YHWH is more accurately pronounced “Yahweh” (Yaw-Way) rather than “Jehovah”.

> "The origin of the word Jehovah can be traced to the late Middle Ages (around the year 1500), when Jewish scribes began inserting the vowels from the Hebrew word adonai (“my Lord”) into the name YHWH. The insertion resulted in the hybrid term YaHoWaH. Scribes wanted this **new word** to remind readers that God’s name was too holy to pronounce, so they should substitute adonah for it when reading biblical passages aloud. Then, when the term YaHoWaH was Latinized, the “Y” and “W” were changed to “J” and “V”—resulting in Jehovah. In other words, **Jehovah is a mistransliteration**, compounded by the fact that, while “J” has a “Y” sound in Latin, it has a very different sound in English—as in the word jam. **Jehovah appears in no literature earlier than about the thirteenth century, and it began to be popularized in the sixteenth century by well-meaning but mistaken Christians.** &mdash; Richard Abanes (The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code, p. 19, 83)"

Here is what other scholars say about the name or pronunciation “Jehovah”: 

- **The Jewish Encyclopedia**: “Jehovah” — a mispronunciation of the Hebrew YHWH the name of God. This pronunciation is grammatically impossible. The form ‘Jehovah’ is a philological impossibility.”
- **The New Jewish Encyclopedia**: “It is clear that the word Jehovah is an artificial composite.”
- **Encyclopedia Judaica**: “the true pronunciation of the tetragrammaton YHWH was never lost. The name was pronounced Yahweh. It was regularly pronounced this way at least until 586 B.C., as is clear from the Lachish Letters written shortly before this date.”
- **The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia**: “JEHOVAH is an erroneous pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton a four lettered name of God, made up of the Hebrew letters Yod He Vav He. The word “JEHOVAH” therefore is a misreading for which there is no warrant and which makes no sense in Hebrew”
- **Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary**: “Jehovah” — “False reading of the Hebrew YAHWEH.”
- **Encyclopedia Americana**: “Jehovah” — “erroneous form of the name of the God of Israel.”
- **A Dictionary of the Bible by William Smith**: “Whatever, therefore, be the true pronunciation of the word, there can be little doubt that it is not Jehovah.”
- **Encyclopedia Britannica**: “The pronunciation ‘Jehovah’ is an error resulting among Christians from combining the consonants YHWH with the vowels of ADHONAY….The Masoretes who from the 6th to the 10th century worked to reproduce the original text of the Hebrew Bible replaced the vowels of the name YHWH with the vowel signs of Adonai or Elohim. Thus the artificial name Jehovah came into being.”
- **Webster’s Third New International Dictionary**: “Jehovah” — “Intended as a transliteration of Hebrew YAHWEH, the vowel points of Hebrew ADHONAY (my lord) being erroneously substituted for those of YAHWEH; from the fact that in some Hebrew manuscripts the vowel points of ADHONAY (used as a euphemism for YAHWEH) were written under the consonants YHWH of YAHWEH to indicate that ADHONAY was to be substituted in oral reading for YAHWEH. Jehovah is a Christian transliteration of the tetragrammaton long assumed by many Christians to be the authentic reproduction of the Hebrew sacred name for God but now recognized to be a late hybrid form never used by the Jews.”
- **New Catholic Encyclopedia:** “Jehovah” — “false form of the divine name YAHWEH.”
- **The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia:** “Jehovah” — “is an erroneous form of the divine name of the covenant God Israel.”
- **The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible:** “Jehovah” — “is an artificial form.”
- **Encyclopedia International:** “Jehovah” —”the vowels of one word with the consonants of the other were misread as ‘Jehovah.'”
- **Merits Students Encyclopedia**: — “is an inaccurate reconstruction of the name of God in the Old Testament.”
- **Encyclopedia Judaica**: “YHWH” — “When Christian scholars of Europe first began to study Hebrew, they did not understand what this really meant, and they introduced the hybrid name ‘Jehovah’…THE TRUE PRONUNCIATION OF THE NAME YHWH WAS NEVER LOST. Several early Greek writers of the Christian church testify that the name was pronounced ‘YAHWEH.’ This is confirmed, at least for the vowel of the first syllable of the name, by the shorter form Yah, which is sometimes used in poetry (e.g. Exodus 15:2)… The personal name of God of Israel is written in the Hebrew Bible with the four consonants YHWH and is referred to as the ‘Tetragrammaton.’ At least until the destruction of the First Temple in 586 B.C.E. this name was regularly pronounced with its proper vowels, as is clear from the Lachish Letters, written shortly before that date.”
- **Nelson’s Bible Dictionary**: “Jehovah” — “The divine name Yahweh is usually translated Lord in English versions of the Bible, because it became a practice in late Old Testament Judaism not to pronounce the sacred name YHWH, but to say instead “my Lord” (Adonai) – a practice still used today in the synagogue. When the vowels of Adonai were attached to the consonants YHWH in the medieval period, the word Jehovah resulted. Today, many Christians use the word Yahweh, the more original pronunciation, not hesitating to name the divine name since Jesus taught believers to speak in a familiar way to God.”

Here is a [comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Exodus%203:15) of Exodus 3:15 where God reveals his covenant name.

> The translation “Yahweh” is substantiated by scholarly reconstruction as well as by historical discussions in Theodoret, Epiphanius, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Aquila. Consequently, those latter individuals affirm the usage of God’s covenant name in the period of the early church. &mdash; [lsbible.org](https://lsbible.org/)

If the name of God is so important, which it definitely is, then we should not only pronounce it correctly, but spell it correctly too. As a side note, only the LSB, LEB, WEB, and NOG Bible versions completely restore Yahweh in the Old Testament. Whenever you see LORD in all caps, this is YHWH in scripture. More on this later.

<span style="font-family:monospace;font-style:Italic;font-size:40px;">Book Of Life or Tree Of Life?</span>

There are certain verses in the Bible which are so pivotal that they're reason enough to throw away certain versions that get them wrong. An explanation as to why you cannot lose your salvation and be erased from the book of life can be read in [this article](https://www.gotquestions.org/erased-book-life.html). Here is a [comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Revelation%2022:19) of Bible versions.

> For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, **If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the** <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Red;">book of life</span>, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. &mdash; Revelation 22:18-19 KJV (King James Version)

> I bear witness to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: **If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book. 19 And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the** <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Green;">tree of life</span> and from the holy city, which are written in this book. &mdash; Revelation 22:18-19 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible, update to the worlds most accurate version, NASB '95)

NET Bible Translator Notes:

> Revelation 22:19 tc The Textus Receptus, on which the KJV rests, reads “the book” of life (ἀπὸ βίβλου, apo biblou) instead of “the tree” of life. **When the Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus translated the NT he had access to no Greek mss for the last six verses of Revelation.** So he translated the Latin Vulgate back into Greek at this point. **As a result he created seventeen textual variants which were not in any Greek mss.** The most notorious of these is this reading. **It is thus decidedly inauthentic, while “the tree” of life, found in the best and virtually all Greek mss, is clearly authentic.** The confusion was most likely due to an intra-Latin switch: The form of the word for “tree” in Latin in this passage is ligno; the word for “book” is libro. The two-letter difference accounts for an accidental alteration in some Latin mss; that “book of life” as well as “tree of life” is a common expression in the Apocalypse probably accounts for why this was not noticed by Erasmus or the KJV translators. (This textual problem is not discussed in NA27.)

😥 This one is hard for me, and if it weren't for this issue (among others) I'd be using the NKJV, I grew up with this version, it is near and dear to my heart.

<span style="font-family:monospace;font-style:Italic;font-size:40px;">Which Textual Criticism Methodology?</span>

Because the last two sections removed the Textus Receptus, I think this is a good time to have that talk.

> There are approximately 300,000 textual variants among New Testament manuscripts. The Majority Text differs from the Textus Receptus in almost 2,000 places. So the agreement is better than 99 percent. But the Majority Text differs from the modern critical text in only about 6,500 places. In other words the two texts agree almost 98 percent of the time. &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor, Ph.D.](https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical#_ftn27)

<span style="font-family:monospace;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">Textus Receptus</span>

> The [Textus Receptus](https://www.gotquestions.org/Textus-Receptus.html) was a manuscript of the Bible that was compiled by a man named Erasmus in the 1500s A.D. He took the limited number of manuscripts he had access to and compiled them into what eventually became known as the Textus Receptus. The Textus Receptus is the textual basis behind the King James Version and New King James Version. &mdash; [Textual Criticism](https://www.gotquestions.org/textual-criticism.html)

<!--There are [27 Greek editions](https://textusreceptusbibles.com/Editions) of the Textus Receptus.--> 

The first printed edition of the Greek New Testament was completed by [Erasmus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Erasmus-Dutch-humanist) and published by Johann Froben of Basel on March 1, 1516 (Novum Instrumentum omne). Due to the pressure of his publisher to bring their edition to market before the competing Complutensian Polyglot, Erasmus based his work on around a half-dozen hand-copied Greek manuscripts, all of which dated from the twelfth century or later; and all but one were of the [Byzantine text-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_text-type). Erasmus did not even transcribe the manuscripts; he merely made notes on the manuscripts themselves and sent them to the printers. Rife with typographical errors, the 1st edition of the Novum Instrumentum omne was printed in only six to eight months.


> "But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they say, even to a blind man, that **often through the translator's clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes**, which we see happen every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep." &mdash; Erasmus, "Epistle 337" in Collected Works of Erasmus Vol. 3, 134.

When Erasmus translated the NT he had access to no Greek mss for the last six verses of Revelation. So he translated the Latin Vulgate back into Greek at this point. As a result he created seventeen to twenty textual variants which were not in any Greek mss. Erasmus adjusted the text in many places to correspond with readings found in the Vulgate or as quoted in the Church Fathers.

> The problem with Erasmus was that he only used really three manuscripts. In fact, **the manuscript Erasmus used for the book of Revelation lacked the last leaf**. He was in a rush to get his Greek New Testament published, because he knew there were others trying to get their editions out. Consequently, **he back translated from his defective copy of the Latin Vulgate into Greek for the last six verses of Revelation**. In the process, he created twenty new textual variants that have not been found in any other manuscripts—except a few that were based on what he did several years later.
>
**Textus Receptus is the Greek text that stands behind the King James Bible.** Contrary to what its name suggests, it is not the text received by all. Even **Erasmus wasn't pleased** with the production. He never liked it. He admitted it was rushed, that it was precipitated rather than produced. He put in eight years of work. By the end, he was tired.
>
In the late 1800s, **Frederick Scrivener said there was no book he had ever seen with as many errors** as the first edition of Erasmus' Greek New Testament. &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor, Ph.D.](https://zondervanacademic.com/blog/textus-receptus)

[Erasmus'](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Erasmus-Dutch-humanist) second edition of the Novum Instrumentum omne became the basis for Luther's German translation, while the third edition was used by William Tyndale for the first English New Testament (1526), by Robert Estienne as a base for his editions of the Greek New Testament from 1546 and 1549, and by the translators of Geneva Bible and King James Version.

Criticized for his work which contained numerous textual errors, he incorporated readings from the Complutensian Polyglot in later editions of his work. It was not until the publication of the Westcott and Hort Greek New Testament in 1881 that the Textus Receptus lost its prominent position as a basis of biblical textual interpretation due to the inception of textual criticism.

> The [Critical Text](https://www.gotquestions.org/critical-text.html) or eclectic method involves considering external and internal evidences for determining the most likely original text. External evidence makes us ask these questions: in how many manuscripts does the reading occur? what are the dates for these manuscripts? in what region of the world were these manuscripts found? Internal evidence prompts these questions: what could have caused these varying readings? which reading can possibly explain the origin of the other readings? The New International Version, New American Standard, New Living Translation, and most other Bible translations use the Eclectic Text. &mdash; [Textual Criticism](https://www.gotquestions.org/textual-criticism.html)


Dismissing the Textus Receptus as an inferior text rife with errors, two prominent scholars, Westcott and Hort compiled a new Greek text in 1881, later called the [Critical Text](https://www.gotquestions.org/critical-text.html). With special focus on two fourth-century manuscripts, the [Codex Vaticanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Vaticanus) and the [Codex Sinaiticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus), they attempted to preserve the most accurate wording possible. Their work dethroned the Textus Receptus and established the critical text, a text which gave evidence to being closer to the New Testament Autographs.

<span style="font-family:monospace;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">Majority Text</span>

> The [Majority Text](https://www.gotquestions.org/majority-text.html) takes all of the manuscripts that are available today, compares the differences, and chooses the most likely correct reading based on which reading occurs the most. For example, if 748 manuscripts read "he said" and 1,429 manuscripts read "they said" the Majority Text will go with "they said" as the most likely original reading. &mdash; [Textual Criticism](https://www.gotquestions.org/textual-criticism.html)
