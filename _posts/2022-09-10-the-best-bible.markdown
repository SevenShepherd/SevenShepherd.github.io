Scholars agree that **no cardinal doctrine is affected** by any viable variant. To be sure, minor doctrinal differences and matters of orthopraxy ("right action") are affected by variants, but regardless of what text one uses, **Jesus is affirmed as God in the flesh, as rising from the dead bodily, as ascending to heaven and as coming again some day.** 

<!-- Although we do not know the exact words of Scripture in every place, even the most disparate schools of thought agree on the vast majority. Depending on how we count, the level of agreement could be up to 98 percent! -->

> "**99.8% of textual variants affect nothing**, most are spelling differences. there's different ways to spell John, there's different ways to spell Mary, they're not going to affect anything, but **the one-fifth of 1% that do affect things are the ones that scholars talk about**. The bottom line is it does not matter in some respects which New Testament you use because **no essential doctrine is jeopardized** by any of these textual variants" &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor, Ph.D.](https://youtu.be/NikVdhp0YFs)

While it is true that no essential doctrine is jeopardized by any textual variants, I am reminded of Solomon's wise words in Ecclesiastes:

> Using a dull ax requires great strength, so sharpen the blade. That’s the value of wisdom; it helps you succeed. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 10:10 NLT (New Living Translation)

We also know that as time progresses, knowledge will increase.

> But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and **knowledge shall be increased**. &mdash; Daniel 12:4 KJV

Remember, that it is the "untaught" that ultimately end up twisting scripture. Scholars are doing the Lord's work, what they say has value.

> as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which **untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures**. &mdash; 2 Peter 3:16 NKJV (New King James Version)

Considering these things, in this article I will attempt to locate a version of the Bible that, in my opinion, is closest to the original autographs. Just keep in mind we're splitting hairs since the New Testament has over a 99.5% textual purity.

> “The interval, then, between the dates of original composition and the earliest extant evidence becomes so small as to be in fact negligible, and the last foundation for any doubt that the Scriptures have come down to us substantially as they were written has now been removed. Both the authenticity and the general integrity of the books of the New Testament may be regarded as finally established.” &mdash; Sir Frederic Kenyon (former director and principal librarian of the British Museum)

<!-- > as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures. &mdash; 2 Peter 3:16 ESV (English Standard Version) -->

<!-- > as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the **untaught** and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction. &mdash; 2 Peter 3:16 NASB '95 (New American Standard Bible 1995) -->

Here is the Lord's Prayer from The Message (MSG) Bible, which is only a paraphrase and not a translation; however, the phrase [*"as above, so below"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_above,_so_below) caught my eye. Suffice It to Say, I will be removing The Message from the line up.

> ...<br>
> Our Father in heaven,<br>
Reveal who you are.<br>
Set the world right;<br>
Do what’s best—<br>
    **as above, so below**.<br>
Keep us alive with three square meals.<br>
Keep us forgiven with you and forgiving others.<br>
Keep us safe from ourselves and the Devil.<br>
You’re in charge!<br>
You can do anything you want!<br>
You’re ablaze in beauty!<br>
    Yes. Yes. Yes. &mdash; Matthew 6:9-13 MSG (The Message)

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">III. Behemoth or Hippopotamus?</span>

The Biblical description of the Behemoth can be found in Job 40:15-24 ([comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Job%2040:15)). As you can see from the comparison, very few versions get this wrong.

<!-- This is [how the verse should read](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Job+40%3A15-24) -->

<!-- <span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">Behemoth</span> -->

> 15 Behold now <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Green;">behemoth</span>, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. 16 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. 17 **He moveth his tail like a cedar:** the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. 18 **His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.** &mdash; [Job 40:15-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+40%3A15-24&version=KJV) KJV (King James Version)

The absurdity of translating Behemoth as hippopotamus is highlighted below. How many hippopotamuses do you know with a tail like a cedar tree? This is obviously a prehistoric creature.

> 15 “Take a look at the <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Red;">hippopotamus!</span> I made him, too, just as I made you! He eats grass like an ox. 16 See his powerful loins and the muscles of his belly. 17 **His tail is as straight as a cedar.** The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit together. 18 His vertebrae lie straight as a tube of **brass**. **His ribs are like iron bars.** &mdash; TLB

The Biblical description of the Leviathan can be found in Job 41 ([comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Job%2041:1)). As you can see from the comparison, very few versions get this wrong.

> “Can you draw out <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Green;">Leviathan</span> with a hook, Or snare his tongue with a line which you lower? ... 15 His rows of scales are his pride, Shut up tightly as with a seal; ... 18 **His sneezings flash forth light**, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 19 **Out of his mouth go burning lights; Sparks of fire shoot out.** 20 Smoke goes out of his nostrils, As from a boiling pot and burning rushes. 21 **His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes out of his mouth.** ... 24 His heart is as hard as stone, Even as hard as the lower millstone. ... 31 **He makes the deep boil like a pot;** He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. &mdash; [Job 41:1,15,18-21,24,31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+41&version=NKJV) NKJV (New King James Version)

This is obviously a prehistoric creature. How many crocodiles do you know of that can breath fire? See the absurd translation of the NLV below.

> “Can you pull the <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Red;">crocodile</span> out with a fish-hook? Can you tie his tongue down with a rope? ..." &mdash; [Job 41:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+41&version=NKJV) NLV (New Life Version)

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">V. Jehovah or Yahweh?</span>

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">The Mistransliteration 'Jehovah' Was Never Used By The Jews</span>

Jewish and Christian scholars, who are thoroughly familiar with the Old Testament Hebrew language and how to pronounce Hebrew words, make it clear that the Hebrew word YHWH is more accurately pronounced “Yahweh” (Yaw-Way) rather than “Jehovah”.

> "The origin of the word Jehovah can be traced to the late Middle Ages (around the year 1500), when Jewish scribes began inserting the vowels from the Hebrew word adonai (“my Lord”) into the name YHWH. The insertion resulted in the hybrid term YaHoWaH. Scribes wanted this **new word** to remind readers that God’s name was too holy to pronounce, so they should substitute adonah for it when reading biblical passages aloud. Then, when the term YaHoWaH was Latinized, the “Y” and “W” were changed to “J” and “V”—resulting in Jehovah. In other words, **Jehovah is a mistransliteration**, compounded by the fact that, while “J” has a “Y” sound in Latin, it has a very different sound in English—as in the word jam. **Jehovah appears in no literature earlier than about the thirteenth century, and it began to be popularized in the sixteenth century by well-meaning but mistaken Christians.** &mdash; Richard Abanes (The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code, p. 19, 83)"

Here is what other scholars say about the name or pronunciation “Jehovah”: 

- **The Jewish Encyclopedia**: “Jehovah” — a mispronunciation of the Hebrew YHWH the name of God. This pronunciation is grammatically impossible. The form ‘Jehovah’ is a philological impossibility.”
- **The New Jewish Encyclopedia**: “It is clear that the word Jehovah is an artificial composite.”
- **Encyclopedia Judaica**: “the true pronunciation of the tetragrammaton YHWH was never lost. The name was pronounced Yahweh. It was regularly pronounced this way at least until 586 B.C., as is clear from the Lachish Letters written shortly before this date.”
- **The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia**: “JEHOVAH is an erroneous pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton a four lettered name of God, made up of the Hebrew letters Yod He Vav He. The word “JEHOVAH” therefore is a misreading for which there is no warrant and which makes no sense in Hebrew”
- **Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary**: “Jehovah” — “False reading of the Hebrew YAHWEH.”
- **Encyclopedia Americana**: “Jehovah” — “erroneous form of the name of the God of Israel.”
- **A Dictionary of the Bible by William Smith**: “Whatever, therefore, be the true pronunciation of the word, there can be little doubt that it is not Jehovah.”
- **Encyclopedia Britannica**: “The pronunciation ‘Jehovah’ is an error resulting among Christians from combining the consonants YHWH with the vowels of ADHONAY….The Masoretes who from the 6th to the 10th century worked to reproduce the original text of the Hebrew Bible replaced the vowels of the name YHWH with the vowel signs of Adonai or Elohim. Thus the artificial name Jehovah came into being.”
- **Webster’s Third New International Dictionary**: “Jehovah” — “Intended as a transliteration of Hebrew YAHWEH, the vowel points of Hebrew ADHONAY (my lord) being erroneously substituted for those of YAHWEH; from the fact that in some Hebrew manuscripts the vowel points of ADHONAY (used as a euphemism for YAHWEH) were written under the consonants YHWH of YAHWEH to indicate that ADHONAY was to be substituted in oral reading for YAHWEH. Jehovah is a Christian transliteration of the tetragrammaton long assumed by many Christians to be the authentic reproduction of the Hebrew sacred name for God but now recognized to be a late hybrid form never used by the Jews.”
- **New Catholic Encyclopedia:** “Jehovah” — “false form of the divine name YAHWEH.”
- **The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia:** “Jehovah” — “is an erroneous form of the divine name of the covenant God Israel.”
- **The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible:** “Jehovah” — “is an artificial form.”
- **Encyclopedia International:** “Jehovah” —”the vowels of one word with the consonants of the other were misread as ‘Jehovah.'”
- **Merits Students Encyclopedia**: — “is an inaccurate reconstruction of the name of God in the Old Testament.”
- **Encyclopedia Judaica**: “YHWH” — “When Christian scholars of Europe first began to study Hebrew, they did not understand what this really meant, and they introduced the hybrid name ‘Jehovah’…THE TRUE PRONUNCIATION OF THE NAME YHWH WAS NEVER LOST. Several early Greek writers of the Christian church testify that the name was pronounced ‘YAHWEH.’ This is confirmed, at least for the vowel of the first syllable of the name, by the shorter form Yah, which is sometimes used in poetry (e.g. Exodus 15:2)… The personal name of God of Israel is written in the Hebrew Bible with the four consonants YHWH and is referred to as the ‘Tetragrammaton.’ At least until the destruction of the First Temple in 586 B.C.E. this name was regularly pronounced with its proper vowels, as is clear from the Lachish Letters, written shortly before that date.”
- **Nelson’s Bible Dictionary**: “Jehovah” — “The divine name Yahweh is usually translated Lord in English versions of the Bible, because it became a practice in late Old Testament Judaism not to pronounce the sacred name YHWH, but to say instead “my Lord” (Adonai) – a practice still used today in the synagogue. When the vowels of Adonai were attached to the consonants YHWH in the medieval period, the word Jehovah resulted. Today, many Christians use the word Yahweh, the more original pronunciation, not hesitating to name the divine name since Jesus taught believers to speak in a familiar way to God.”

Here is a [comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Exodus%203:15) of Exodus 3:15 where God reveals his covenant name.

> The translation “Yahweh” is substantiated by scholarly reconstruction as well as by historical discussions in Theodoret, Epiphanius, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Aquila. Consequently, those latter individuals affirm the usage of God’s covenant name in the period of the early church. &mdash; [lsbible.org](https://lsbible.org/)

If the name of God is so important, which it definitely is, then we should not only pronounce it correctly, but spell it correctly too. As a side note, only the LSB, LEB, WEB, and NOG Bible versions completely restore Yahweh in the Old Testament. Whenever you see LORD in all caps, this is YHWH in scripture. More on this later.

There are certain textual variants which are so pivotal that they're reason enough to warrant serious investigation. An explanation as to why you cannot lose your salvation and be erased from the book of life can be read in [this article](https://www.gotquestions.org/erased-book-life.html). Here is a [comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Revelation%2022:19) of Bible versions. 

> For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, **If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the** <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Red;">book of life</span>, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. &mdash; Revelation 22:18-19 KJV (King James Version)

NET Bible Translator Notes:

> Revelation 22:19 tc The Textus Receptus, on which the KJV rests, reads “the book” of life (ἀπὸ βίβλου, apo biblou) instead of “the tree” of life. **When the Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus translated the NT he had access to no Greek mss for the last six verses of Revelation.** So he translated the Latin Vulgate back into Greek at this point. **As a result he created seventeen textual variants which were not in any Greek mss.** The most notorious of these is this reading. **It is thus decidedly inauthentic, while “the tree” of life, found in the best and virtually all Greek mss, is clearly authentic.** The confusion was most likely due to an intra-Latin switch: The form of the word for “tree” in Latin in this passage is ligno; the word for “book” is libro. The two-letter difference accounts for an accidental alteration in some Latin mss; that “book of life” as well as “tree of life” is a common expression in the Apocalypse probably accounts for why this was not noticed by Erasmus or the KJV translators. (This textual problem is not discussed in NA27.)

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">VIII. The Lucifer Problem</span>

The word Lucifer is not a proper name, but the Latin word for ‘morning star,’ which literally referred to Venus in the Latin Vulgate. The KJV translators duplicated the word used in the Latin Vulgate instead of translating it. Here is a [comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Isaiah%2014:12).

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">Controversy</span>

Net Bible Translator Notes:

> Isaiah 14:12 tn The Hebrew text has הֵילֵל בֶּן־שָׁחַר (helel ben shakhar, “Helel son of Shachar”), which is probably **a name for the morning star (Venus)** or the crescent moon. See HALOT 245 s.v. הֵילֵל. ...

An exceptional [article](https://bible.org/article/lucifer-devil-isaiah-1412-kjv-argument-against-modern-translations) was written by one of the world's foremost scholars and senior research professors on this topic. Let's take a quick look at the verse in question. 

> In Isa 14:12 KJV, The KJV translators did not actually translate the Hebrew word ‏הילל as ‘Lucifer.’ This word occurs only here in the Hebrew Old Testament. Most likely, **the KJV translators were not sure what to make of it, and simply duplicated the word used in the Latin Vulgate** that translated ‏הילל.
>
the Vulgate, Isa 14:12 KJV reads as follows:
>
>> quomodo cecidisti de caelo lucifer qui mane oriebaris corruisti in terram qui vulnerabas gentes.
>
Notice the fifth word of the text—lucifer. **It is not a proper name but the Latin word for ‘morning star.’** The word lucifer occurs four times in the Vulgate: Isa 14:12 KJV, Job 11:17 KJV, Job 38:32 KJV, and 2 Peter 1:19 KJV. 
>
In Job 11:17 KJV, the KJV renders the Hebrew word ‏בקר as ‘morning’:
>
>> et quasi meridianus fulgor consurget tibi ad vesperam et cum te consumptum putaveris orieris ut lucifer 
>
In other words, **‘morning star’ or lucifer in the Latin Vulgate literally referred to Venus**, but metaphorically would refer to earthly kings, emperors, and pagan deities. 
>

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">IX. Which Textual Criticism Methodology?</span>

Because the last four sections removed the Textus Receptus, I think this is a good time to have that talk.

> There are approximately 300,000 textual variants among New Testament manuscripts. **The Majority Text differs from the Textus Receptus in almost 2,000 places.** So the agreement is better than 99 percent. But the Majority Text differs from the modern critical text in only about 6,500 places. In other words the two texts agree almost 98 percent of the time. &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor, Ph.D.](https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical#_ftn27)

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">Textus Receptus</span>

> The [Textus Receptus](https://www.gotquestions.org/Textus-Receptus.html) was a manuscript of the Bible that was compiled by a man named Erasmus in the 1500s A.D. He took the limited number of manuscripts he had access to and compiled them into what eventually became known as the Textus Receptus. The Textus Receptus is the textual basis behind the King James Version and New King James Version. &mdash; [Textual Criticism](https://www.gotquestions.org/textual-criticism.html)

The first printed edition of the Greek New Testament was completed by [Erasmus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Erasmus-Dutch-humanist) and published by Johann Froben of Basel on March 1, 1516 (Novum Instrumentum omne). Due to the pressure of his publisher to bring their edition to market before the competing Complutensian Polyglot, Erasmus based his work on around a half-dozen hand-copied Greek manuscripts, all of which dated from the twelfth century or later; and all but one were of the [Byzantine text-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_text-type). 

Erasmus did not even transcribe the manuscripts; he merely made notes on the manuscripts themselves and sent them to the printers. Rife with typographical errors, the 1st edition of the Novum Instrumentum omne was printed in only six to eight months.

> "But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they say, even to a blind man, that **often through the translator's clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes**, which we see happen every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep." &mdash; Erasmus, "Epistle 337" in Collected Works of Erasmus Vol. 3, 134.

When Erasmus translated the NT he had access to no Greek mss for the last six verses of Revelation. So he translated the Latin Vulgate back into Greek at this point. As a result he created over a dozen textual variants which were not in any Greek mss. Erasmus adjusted the text in many places to correspond with readings found in the Vulgate or as quoted in the Church Fathers.

> The problem with Erasmus was that he only used really three manuscripts. In fact, **the manuscript Erasmus used for the book of Revelation lacked the last leaf**. He was in a rush to get his Greek New Testament published, because he knew there were others trying to get their editions out. Consequently, **he back translated from his defective copy of the Latin Vulgate into Greek for the last six verses of Revelation**. In the process, he created twenty new textual variants that have not been found in any other manuscripts—except a few that were based on what he did several years later.
>
**Textus Receptus is the Greek text that stands behind the King James Bible.** Contrary to what its name suggests, it is not the text received by all. Even **Erasmus wasn't pleased** with the production. He never liked it. He admitted it was rushed, that it was precipitated rather than produced. He put in eight years of work. By the end, he was tired.
>
In the late 1800s, **Frederick Scrivener said there was no book he had ever seen with as many errors** as the first edition of Erasmus' Greek New Testament. &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor, Ph.D.](https://zondervanacademic.com/blog/textus-receptus)

[Erasmus'](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Erasmus-Dutch-humanist) second edition of the Novum Instrumentum omne became the basis for Luther's German translation, while the third edition was used by William Tyndale for the first English New Testament (1526), by Robert Estienne as a base for his editions of the Greek New Testament from 1546 and 1549, and by the translators of Geneva Bible and King James Version.

Criticized for his work which contained numerous textual errors, he incorporated readings from the Complutensian Polyglot in later editions of his work. It was not until the publication of the Westcott and Hort Greek New Testament in 1881 that the Textus Receptus lost its prominent position as a basis of biblical textual interpretation due to the inception of textual criticism. 

There are [27 Greek editions](https://textusreceptusbibles.com/Editions) of the Textus Receptus. 

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">Critical Text</span>

> The [Critical Text](https://www.gotquestions.org/critical-text.html) or eclectic method involves considering external and internal evidences for determining the most likely original text. External evidence makes us ask these questions: in how many manuscripts does the reading occur? what are the dates for these manuscripts? in what region of the world were these manuscripts found? Internal evidence prompts these questions: what could have caused these varying readings? which reading can possibly explain the origin of the other readings? The New International Version, New American Standard, New Living Translation, and most other Bible translations use the Eclectic Text. &mdash; [Textual Criticism](https://www.gotquestions.org/textual-criticism.html)

Dismissing the Textus Receptus as an inferior text rife with errors, two prominent scholars, Westcott and Hort compiled a new Greek text in 1881, later called the [Critical Text](https://www.gotquestions.org/critical-text.html). With special focus on two fourth-century manuscripts, the [Codex Vaticanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Vaticanus) and the [Codex Sinaiticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus), they attempted to preserve the most accurate wording possible. Their work dethroned the Textus Receptus and established the critical text, a text which gave evidence to being closer to the New Testament Autographs.

> "In comparison with any other ancient Greek or Latin writing, the NT suffers from an embarrassment of riches when it comes to extant copies. The average ancient Greek or Latin author's literary remains are to be found in fewer than two dozen copies, while the NT has about 5,600 extant copies in Greek alone, not to mention the another 10,000 in latin, several thousand copies in other early versions, and several hundred thousand quotations in the early Christian writers known as "the fathers" and referred to as the patristic writers. The NT textual critic not only has significantly more material to work with than textual critics of, say, Demosthenes, Livy, or Josephus, but the MSS are closer to the time of the original documents. Mere decades seperate some of the earliest fragments of the NT from the originals, while hundreds of years seperate the earliest copies of other ancient literature from the author's manuscript." &mdash; Professor Daniel B. Wallace Ph.D.

It's important to note, that today's Critical Text [Novum Testamentum Graece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum_Testamentum_Graece) is not the same as the Westcott and Hort text, and is nigh-infinitely superior with modern day scholarship. There's an incredible amount of history between 1881 and 2022. Instead of going into the history of how we got from WH to NA28 i'd rather investigate our current Greek New Testament manuscript.

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">Majority Text</span>

> The [Majority Text](https://www.gotquestions.org/majority-text.html) takes all of the manuscripts that are available today, compares the differences, and chooses the most likely correct reading based on which reading occurs the most. For example, if 748 manuscripts read "he said" and 1,429 manuscripts read "they said" the Majority Text will go with "they said" as the most likely original reading. &mdash; [Textual Criticism](https://www.gotquestions.org/textual-criticism.html)

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">X. Gender Inclusivness?</span>

The heresy of [political correctness](https://www.gotquestions.org/political-correctness.html) and gender inclusion has invaded the world of Bible translation and perverted God’s original message. There are times when [inclusiveness](https://www.gotquestions.org/gender-inclusive-Bible-translation.html) is appropriate and times when it absolutely is not. Let's look at some examples and remove some of the remaining versions that violate God's message.

Imagine if the following verses only applied to half the population (Men):

<!-- > If someone says, “I love God,” and **hates his brother**, **he is a liar**; for **he** who does not love **his brother** whom **he** has seen, how can **he** love God whom **he** has not seen? &mdash; 1 John 4:20 NKJV (New King James Version) -->

> 20 If **a man** says, “I love God,” and **hates his brother**, **he is a liar**; for **he** who doesn’t love **his brother** whom **he** has seen, how can **he** love God whom **he** has not seen? &mdash; 1 John 4:20 WEB (World English Bible)

This translation isn't necesarily wrong, but those who understand the Bible, understand that 'he' in the Greek is referring to oneself [*αὐτός (autos)*], and 'brother' [*ἀδελφός (adelphos)*] is referring to a member of the Christian community. (See [MOUNCE](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Jn+4%3A20&version=MOUNCE))

> If **someone** says, “I love God,” but **hates a fellow believer**,[a] **that person is a liar**; for if **we** don’t **love people we** can see, how can **we** love God, whom **we** cannot see? &mdash; 1 John 4:20 NLT (New Living Translation)

See also 1 Jn 2:9; 4:8; Titus 3:10; Pr 10:18; 16:28; 20:19; 1 Pe 2:1; James 1:12; 4:11-12; Lk 6:45; Ps 101:5; Mt 5:22; 12:36; Jn 13:35.

<!-- and maybe Gal 5:19-21; 22-23. -->

<span style="font-family:Times;font-style:Italic;font-size:26px;">Controversy</span>

In Acts 1:16 the very first word Men [ἀνήρ (anēr)] is used, which refers only to males even when women are present. This is an instance of God using language in the Bible that is clearly and specifically directed at men (See [MOUNCE](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A16&version=MOUNCE)). Here is a [comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Acts%201:16) of versions.

> “<span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Green;">Men</span>, brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. &mdash; Acts 1:16 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible)

Here are two examples of translations completely butchering the Greek scriptures.

> and said, “Brothers <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Red;">and sisters</span>,[a] the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus. &mdash; Acts 1:16 NIV (New International Version)

> “Brothers <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Red;">and sisters</span>, it was necessary that the Scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the lips of David [king of Israel] about Judas [Iscariot], who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus. &mdash; Acts 1:16 AMP (Amplified Bible)

NET Translator Notes:

> a. Acts 1:16 tn Grk “Men brothers.” In light of the compound phrase ἄνδρες ἀδελφοί (andres adelphoi, “Men brothers”) **Peter’s words are best understood as directly addressed to the males present**, possibly referring specifically to the twelve (really ten at this point—eleven minus the speaker, Peter) mentioned by name in v. 13.
