<!-- <div class="mt">OVERVIEW OF SOTERIOLOGY</div> -->
<div class="mt">SALVATION IS BY GRACE</div>

<!-- Before this article begins I'd like to make clear my soteriological stances, so that there is no misunderstandings about what this ministry is teaching. There is a very large debate between 'free grace theology', and ['lordship salvation'](https://www.gotquestions.org/lordship-salvation.html). -->

<!-- Most of my material leans into lordship salvation but the other decent portion is free grace theology. Some of the brightest scholars you'll ever meet fall on both sides of the isle. So i've decided to remain neutral and allow the reader to decide for himself. -->

<div class="mt" style="font-size:21px;">꧁ Ephesians 2:8-9 ꧂</div>
<!-- <div class="mt" style="font-weight:bold;color:Gold;font-size:21px;">꧁ Under Construction ꧂</div> -->

<blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph+2%3A8-9&version=ESV;NET;NLT"> 

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22" style="font-weight:bold;color:black;">22&#160;</span>God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God. 9 Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. &mdash; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph+2%3A8-9&version=NLT">New Living Translation (NLT)</a></div>

</blockquote>

The Bible teaches that believers are saved by grace (Eph 2:8-9) and justified through faith (Ro 5:1; Gal. 3:24), and that faith is credited to us as righteousness (Ro 4:3,9,22; Ja 2:23; Gal. 3:9). However, the Bible also says, faith without works is dead (James 2:20,22,26). If your faith is dead, how can you be justified?

John the Baptist reprimanded the pharisees, who also believed in God, that they must produce fruit that proves their repentance (Mt 3:8,10). Jesus also taught that you could identify people by their actions (Mt 7:16-20, 21-23). 

If a Christian's life is devoid of the fruit of the Holy spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21), it is possible that they have fooled themselves (Ja 1:22), becoming false professors (2Pe 2:21-22).

<!-- If you truly believe in Christ you have nothing to worry about, you cannot lose your salvation. End of story. -->

<!-- In this article we are not examining justification or glorification. We're examining sanctification vs lip service (Tit 1:16; Is 29:13; Mt 15:8).  -->

<!-- the former leads to a lifestyle of practicing sin and the latter leads to soteriological sanctification. -->

In this article we examine the difference between lip service (Tit 1:16; Is 29:13; Mt 15:8) and justification. One path leads to the practice of sin (1Jn 3:9-10) and the other to soteriological sanctification (Phil 2:12). 

<!-- Let us not give unrepentant sinners false hope; rather, let us declare the whole counsel of God: “You must be born again” (Jn 3:7). Faith without works is dead (James 2:26), and if your faith is dead, how can you be justified? -->

<div class="mt">TRUE CHRISTIANS DO NOT PRACTICE SIN</div>

The keyword here is <span style="font-size:24px;color:#595959;">practice</span>. A true Christian is incapable of practicing sin. Scholars have defined this as *"living in a continual pattern"*. **This is not the same thing as making a mistake.** This is talking about your habits and lifestyle.

> **3:9-10** ... In other words, because the Word is present in the believer’s heart through the work of the Spirit, **the believer cannot keep on sinning**. Thus the hearts of genuine Christians (those who are truly children of God) have been so transformed that **they cannot live in a pattern of continual sin**—though this does not mean that Christians are ever completely free from sin in this life (see 1 John 1:8–10). By this it is evident. Or, as Jesus said of false prophets, *“You will recognize them by their fruits”* (Matt. 7:16).

# Chuck Smith C2000

> 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don’t know Him. I really haven’t seen Him. If I really know Him, then I’m gonna be free from the practice of sin.**

> 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. So again, don’t deceive yourself. <span style="color:#C70039;">If you are **practicing** sin, living in sin, you are not of God; you are a part of that rebellion against God, led by Satan.</span>

# Dr. Jack Van Impe

Jack Van Impe makes and interesting statement which raises an important question. Are "Believers" who continue to practice sin, the "ashamed," at Christs coming, or were they never "True Believers" to begin with?

> There is no sin that can keep a **true believer** out of [Heaven](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/heaven/). God's Word clearly states that some Christians will be saved *"so as by fire."* They lose everything except their salvation. Because of it they will be *"ashamed"* in Christ's presence (1Jn 2:28 KJV).<sup style="font-size:10px;">[JVI]</sup>
>
If believers were left behind at the Rapture because of some sin in their lives, who would the *"ashamed"* be at that investigative session? Rewards are lost because of disobedience and disobedience is a sin (Ro 5:19; James 5:17).<sup style="font-size:10px;">[JVI]</sup>

The Bible goes even further and adds that not only should we be showing evidence of our salvation by grace through how we live our lives, but that if we don't we're deceiveing ourselves (Ja 1:22). The Bible says that we should test ourselves to see if we're truly in the faith (2 Cor. 13:5).

> **7:21–23** The kingdom community must guard against not only false prophets (vv. 15–20) but also false disciples. Lord, Lord. **An oral confession of Jesus as Lord does not always indicate a repentant heart.**

> **7:23** then will I declare to them. Jesus says that he will one day exercise the prerogative of condemning people to hell, something that only God can do (cf. note on John 5:22). Though these condemned prophets appeared to belong to Jesus, they were **never truly saved**, for Jesus never knew them (cf. note on Matt. 7:21–23).

<!-- A true believer is someone who has truly repented of their sins and turned to God. They do not make a **practice** of sin (1Jn 3:9-10 ESV; Gal 5:19-21), and their life is filled with the fruit of the spirit (Gal 5:22-23). The Bible makes it clear that everyone receives the Holy Spirit the moment he or she believes in Jesus Christ (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 1:13-14). -->

> b. Jude 1:1 **tn** **For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege.** It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were “servants (or slaves) of the Lord.”

> b. Revelation 1:1 **tn** Grk “slaves.” Although this translation frequently renders δοῦλος (doulos) as “slave,” **the connotation is often of one who has sold himself into slavery; in a spiritual sense, the idea is that of becoming a slave of God or of Jesus Christ voluntarily.** The voluntary notion is conspicuous here; hence, the translation “servants.” In any case, **the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another.** BDAG notes that “‘servant’ for ‘slave’ is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times…in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished” (BDAG 260 s.v.). **A good translation is “bondservant”** (sometimes found in the ASV for δοῦλος), **in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another.** But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.

131 Scholars including it's derived [NASB ‘95 & ‘77](https://www.lockman.org/new-american-standard-bible-nasb/), otherwise [70+ scholars](https://lsbible.org/faqs/). The Legacy Standard Bible is a worthy update to the NASB '95, which was already considered by scholars as the most accurate version of the Bible ever produced.

> Why does the LSB translate “doulos” as “slave”?
>
The NT has a variety of terms that refer to the individuals who serve under the authority of another. Doulos denotes a very specific form of servitude: slavery. **The NT uses doulos to describe an individual who is totally subordinate to a master (cf. Matt 8:9 LSB; Matt 24:46 LSB; 2 Pet 2:19 LSB) and even owned by that master (Phile 1:16-19 LSB)**, in contrast to one who is freed (Gal 3:28 LSB). For this reason, the NASB already translated the vast majority of this term as slave. The LSB made this consistent, which brings out how believers are to relate to Christ. **He is our Lord and master (2 Cor 4:5 LSB), and we are His slaves (Rom 1:1 LSB; Phil 1:1 LSB). This underscores His great redemption in buying believers from slavery to sin (Rom 6:16 LSB). This also underscores the believer’s absolute surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom 6:16-17 LSB).** A consistent translation of doulos, in effect, sharpens the very nature of the Christian life.

# Chuck Smith C2000
> Jesus on another occasion said, "Why do you call me Lord and yet you don’t do the things that I command you?" You see, our problem is that we’ve come to think of the term "Lord" as a name and so we say, "The Lord Jesus Christ" and we think of Lord as His first name, Jesus His middle name and Christ His last name; He’s the Lord Jesus Christ. **But in reality when I say the Lord, you should put a comma there for Lord is not his name; it’s His title. The title that signifies my relationship to Him. <span style="color:#29a329;">He is my Lord, I am his slave; I am his servant, He is my Lord.</span>**

We believe that the **evidence** of your salvation by Grace is proven by the way that you live, and that works are the byproduct of salvation, not it's cause. There is a clear distinction between practicing sin and making mistakes. A true Christian does not practice sin.

So in conclusion, let us not give unrepentant sinners false hope; rather, let us declare the whole counsel of God: “You must be born again” (Jn 3:7). Faith without works is dead (James 2:20,22,26)!

<!-- The Bible tells us that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23), and that there is no one who is righteous (Rom. 3:10).

The evidence of your salvation by Grace (Eph 2:8-9) is proven by the way you live (Mt 3:8). Jesus taught that you could identify people by their fruit, that is by the way that they act (Matthew 7:16-21). -->

<!-- I repeat, Christians are saved by Grace. The work of the Holy spirit in the lives of true believers will in fact bare fruit. If thats not happening, it's likely they didn't mean it, and were never really saved in the first place. **Works are the byproduct of salvation, not its cause, which is Grace.** -->
