<blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph+2%3A8-9&version=ESV;NET;NLT"> 

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22" style="font-weight:bold;color:black;">22&#160;</span>God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can‚Äôt take credit for this; it is a gift from God. 9 Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. &mdash; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph+2%3A8-9&version=NLT">New Living Translation (NLT)</a></div>

</blockquote>

The Bible teaches that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23), and that no one is righteous (Rom. 3:10). *"God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."* (Rom. 5:8 ESV).

> "For the wages of sin is death, but the <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:21px;color:#29a329;">free gift</span> of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord." &mdash; Romans 6:23

Salvation comes from the Grace of God when we believed (Jn 3:16), we were justified through faith (Ro 5:1 ESV; Gal. 3:24 ESV), and faith was credited to us as righteousness (Ro 4:3,9,22; Jas 2:23; Gal. 3:9).

# What Is The Fruit Of The Holy Spirit?

> But the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">fruit</span> of the Spirit is **love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control**; against such things there is no law. &mdash; Galatians 5:22-23 ESV

The Bible makes it crystal clear that we receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit the moment we believe in Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:9; 1Cor. 12:13; Eph 1:13-14). The Holy Spirit conforms us to the image of Christ, making us more like Him. We see this manifest in our lives through the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">fruit</span> that the presence of the Holy Spirit produces.

> By this my Father is glorified, that you <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples</span>. &mdash; John 15:8 ESV

<!-- >
**True disciples** will experience a transformed, fruit-bearing life because they live in a relationship of love with both Jesus and the Father (Jn 15:9-10) &mdash; [Filament](https://amzn.to/3CcB5Cu) -->

If a Christian's life is devoid of the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">fruit</span> of the Holy spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21), they have likely deceived themselves (James 1:22) into believing that they have genuine faith (2Cor. 13:5). 

<!-- This is what is known as a false professor (2Pe 2:21-22).  -->

<!-- They did not lose their salvation, for this is impossible, they were just never saved to begin with. -->

<!-- Not only will they not inherit the Kingdom of God (Gal. 5:21), false professors will end up in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone forever. -->

# Faith Without Good Deeds Is Not Genuine Faith

The Bible says that faith without works is dead (James 2:20,26). It even goes as far as to say *"... a person is justified <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">by works</span> and not by faith alone."* (James 2:24 ESV). 

> So you see, we are shown to be right with God <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">by what we do</span>, not by faith alone. &mdash; James 2:24 NLT

<!-- Some have thought that this teaching contradicts what Paul taught, it does not.  -->

- <span style="color:#cc0000;">The context reveals that Paul (Rom 3:20, 28; Gal 2:16; 3:10‚Äì12) was referring to ‚Äúworks‚Äù (erga) of <span style="font-weight:bold;">Jewish law</span></span>
- <span style="color:#800080;">While James was referring to showing one‚Äôs faith through doing <span style="font-weight:bold;">good deeds</span></span>.<sup>[[FaithLife]](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jas2.24)</sup>

> Jas 2:22 ... Abraham was not **justified** by his actions alone; instead, **his faith and <span style="color:#800080;">his actions</span> worked together**. ...

James was making the point that we should not be like the demons who merely believe something is true (Jas 2:19), but by a belief that results in <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">generous deeds</span> like those of God himself (Jas 1:17).<sup>[[Filament]](https://amzn.to/3CcB5Cu)</sup>

<!-- > **8** Therefore produce <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">fruit</span><span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[a]</span> that proves your<span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[b]</span> repentance, ... **10** Even now the ax is laid at<span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[d]</span> the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">fruit</span> will be cut down and thrown into the fire. &mdash; [Matt. 3:8-10 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+3%3A8-10&version=ESV;NET;NLT)
>
a. Matthew 3:8 **sn** <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">Fruit</span> that proves your repentance <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">refers to the deeds</span> that indicate a change of attitude (heart) on the part of John‚Äôs hearers.

Not only is it dead, but both John the Baptist and Jesus ([God manifest](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/deity/)) warned that faith that was not accompanied by <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">good deeds</span> would lead to the lake of fire. -->

<!-- If your faith is dead, are you justified? -->

<!-- # Lordship Salvation vs Free Grace Theology

There is a very large debate between 'free grace theology', and ['lordship salvation'](https://www.gotquestions.org/lordship-salvation.html). Each extreme has resorted to derogatory terms to refer to the other; for instance 'free grace theology' is referred to as '[easy believism](https://www.gotquestions.org/easy-believism.html)' and 'lordship salvation' is **sometimes** erroneously referred to as 'works righteousness'. I say **sometimes** because there are different versions.

The controversy is over these two positions on salvation
- Salvation is by faith alone, and nothing more.
- Salvation is by faith which is accompanied by a submission to the Lordship of Christ and repentance.

The order of salvation (ordo salutis), plays a big role. Regeneration either precedes faith, or faith proceeds regeneration. 
- If **regeneration precedes faith**, then God is changing the person and enabling him to believe the gospel and repent (2Cor. 5:17). Repentance is the result of God‚Äôs regenerative work in us.
- If **faith proceeds regeneration**, then salvation is obtained by faith in God **and** turning from sin (Mark 1:15). This is teaching that salvation is not by faith alone in Christ alone which amounts to keeping the Law. This is, obviously **false**.

Free grace, on the other hand (systematized in the 1980s with traditional Baptist roots), teaches:
- A Christian can live in lifelong carnality, enjoying the pleasures of sin, and never seeking to glorify the Lord who bought him. 
- A sinner can spurn the lordship of Christ and yet lay claim to Him as Savior. 
- One can pray the ‚Äúsinner‚Äôs prayer‚Äù and go about his life as if nothing had happened and still call himself a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù. 
    
This is, of course, **false**. -->

<!-- > Is it possible to be a Christian and live in lifelong carnality, enjoying the pleasures of sin, and never seeking to glorify the Lord who bought him? Can a sinner spurn the lordship of Christ yet lay claim to Him as Savior? Can someone pray a ‚Äúsinner‚Äôs prayer‚Äù and go about his life as if nothing had happened and still call himself a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù? **Lordship salvation says ‚Äúno.‚Äù** Let us not give unrepentant sinners false hope; rather, let us declare the whole counsel of God: ‚ÄúYou must be born again‚Äù (John 3:7). -->

# By Grace Alone, Through Faith Alone, In Christ Alone.

So there is no misunderstandings on what this ministry is teaching; we champion the core positions of the 16th century Protestant Reformation known as the *five solas*. These latin phrases were developed as a response to heresies found in the Roman Catholic Church, and are more commonly recognized in the Reformed perspective.

<!-- We believe that salvation is **by Grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone**. Our stance is that of the **regeneration precedes faith**. The latin phrases known as the *five solas* represent the core positions of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century.  -->

<!-- - Scripture alone (*Sola Scriptura*)
    - 1Co 4:6
- Christ alone (*Solus Christus*)
    - Jn 14:6; 1Ti 2:5; Jn 1:1-3,14,18
- Grace alone (*Sola Gratia*)
    - Eph 2:8-9; Ti 3:5
- Faith alone (*Sola Fide*)
    - Ro 5:1 ESV; Gal. 3:24 ESV
- Glory of God alone (*Soli Deo Gloria*)
    - 1Pe 2:24; Is 43:7 -->

|Five Solas||
|:-:|:-:|
|Scripture alone<br>(*Sola Scriptura*)|1Co 4:6|
|Christ alone<br>(*Solus Christus*)|Jn 14:6; 1Ti 2:5; Jn 1:1-3,14,18|
|Grace alone<br>(*Sola Gratia*)|Eph 2:8-9; Ti 3:5|
|Faith alone<br>(*Sola Fide*)|Ro 5:1 ESV; Gal. 3:24 ESV|
|Glory of God alone<br>(*Soli Deo Gloria*)|1Pe 2:24; Is 43:7|

<!-- The *five solas* are more commonly recognized in the Reformed perspective and were developed in that time period as a response to heresies found in the Roman Catholic Church. -->

It is God who grants repentance (2Ti 2:25 NET) and faith (Phil 1:29 NET). The Lordship of Christ and our repentance are both the natural result of the work of God ‚Äì not the work of our faith and repentance.

# Purpose Of This Article

This articles purpose is to supply a guide for Christians to test themselves, their walk, and their faith as the Bible instructs. It is not written in judgement. We should all inspect ourselves for lip service (Tit 1:16; Is 29:13; Mt 15:8), and false professing (2Pe 2:21-22).

> **Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves.** Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith. &mdash; 2Cor. 13:5 [New Living Translation (NLT)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013:5&version=ESV;NET;NLT)

Lastly, let us not give unrepentant sinners false hope; rather, let us declare the whole counsel of God: *‚ÄúYou must be born again‚Äù* (Jn 3:7).

<!-- If you truly believe in Christ you have nothing to worry about, you cannot lose your salvation. End of story. -->

<!-- In this article we are not examining justification or glorification. We're examining sanctification vs lip service (Tit 1:16; Is 29:13; Mt 15:8).  -->

<!-- the former leads to a lifestyle of practicing sin and the latter leads to soteriological sanctification. -->

The keyword here is <span style="font-size:24px;color:#595959;">practice</span>. A true Christian is incapable of practicing sin. Scholars have defined this as *"living in a continual pattern"*. This is talking about your habits and lifestyle. **This is not the same thing as making a mistake.**

> **3:9-10** ... In other words, because the Word is present in the believer‚Äôs heart through the work of the Spirit, **the believer cannot keep on sinning. Thus the hearts of genuine Christians (those who are truly children of God) have been so transformed that they cannot live in a pattern of continual sin**‚Äîthough this does not mean that Christians are ever completely free from sin in this life (see 1 John 1:8‚Äì10). By this it is evident. Or, as Jesus said of false prophets, *‚ÄúYou will recognize them by their fruits‚Äù* (Matt. 7:16).

> 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don‚Äôt know Him. I really haven‚Äôt seen Him. If I really know Him, then I‚Äôm gonna be free from the practice of sin.**

> 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

# Dr. Jack Van Impe

Jack Van Impe makes and interesting statement which raises an important question. Are "believers" who continue to practice sin, the "<span style="color:#C70039;">ashamed</span>," at Christs coming, or were they never "true believers" to begin with?

> There is no sin that can keep a **true believer** out of [Heaven](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/heaven/). God's Word clearly states that some Christians will be saved *"so as by fire."* They lose everything except their salvation. Because of it they will be *"<span style="color:#C70039;">ashamed</span>"* in Christ's presence (1Jn 2:28 KJV).<sup style="font-size:10px;">[JVI]</sup>
>
If believers were left behind at the Rapture because of some sin in their lives, who would the *"<span style="color:#C70039;">ashamed</span>"* be at that investigative session? Rewards are lost because of disobedience and disobedience is a sin (Ro 5:19; James 5:17).<sup style="font-size:10px;">[JVI]</sup>

The [NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A28&version=NET) Notes takes the context into consideration and also takes a harder stance than Impe. In either case do we really want to be living in a practice of continual sin when God returns?

> **7:21‚Äì23** The kingdom community must guard against not only false prophets (vv. 15‚Äì20) but also false disciples. Lord, Lord. **An oral confession of Jesus as Lord does not always indicate a repentant heart.**

> **7:23** then will I declare to them. Jesus says that he will one day exercise the prerogative of condemning people to hell, something that only God can do (cf. note on John 5:22). Though these condemned prophets appeared to belong to Jesus, they were **never truly saved**, for Jesus never knew them (cf. note on Matt. 7:21‚Äì23).

<!-- A true believer is someone who has truly repented of their sins and turned to God.

Jude 1:1 **tn** **For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege.** It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were ‚Äúservants (or slaves) of the Lord.‚Äù

> b. Revelation 1:1 **tn** Grk ‚Äúslaves.‚Äù Although this translation frequently renders Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ (doulos) as ‚Äúslave,‚Äù **the connotation is often of one who has sold himself into slavery; in a spiritual sense, the idea is that of becoming a slave of God or of Jesus Christ voluntarily.** The voluntary notion is conspicuous here; hence, the translation ‚Äúservants.‚Äù In any case, **the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another.** BDAG notes that ‚Äú‚Äòservant‚Äô for ‚Äòslave‚Äô is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times‚Ä¶in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished‚Äù (BDAG 260 s.v.). **A good translation is ‚Äúbondservant‚Äù** (sometimes found in the ASV for Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ), **in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another.** But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.

131 Scholars including it's derived [NASB ‚Äò95 & ‚Äò77](https://www.lockman.org/new-american-standard-bible-nasb/), otherwise [70+ scholars](https://lsbible.org/faqs/). The Legacy Standard Bible is a worthy update to the NASB '95, which was already considered by scholars as the most accurate version of the Bible ever produced.

> Why does the LSB translate ‚Äúdoulos‚Äù as ‚Äúslave‚Äù?
>
The NT has a variety of terms that refer to the individuals who serve under the authority of another. Doulos denotes a very specific form of servitude: slavery. **The NT uses doulos to describe an individual who is totally subordinate to a master (cf. Matt 8:9 NET; Matt 24:46 NET; 2 Pet 2:19 NET) and even owned by that master (Phile 1:16-19 NET)**, in contrast to one who is freed (Gal 3:28 NET). For this reason, the NASB already translated the vast majority of this term as slave. The LSB made this consistent, which brings out how believers are to relate to Christ. **He is our Lord and master (2 Cor 4:5 NET), and we are His slaves (Rom 1:1 NET; Phil 1:1 NET). This underscores His great redemption in buying believers from slavery to sin (Rom 6:16 NET). This also underscores the believer‚Äôs absolute surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom 6:16-17 NET).** A consistent translation of doulos, in effect, sharpens the very nature of the Christian life.

> Jesus on another occasion said, "Why do you call me Lord and yet you don‚Äôt do the things that I command you?" You see, our problem is that we‚Äôve come to think of the term "Lord" as a name and so we say, "The Lord Jesus Christ" and we think of Lord as His first name, Jesus His middle name and Christ His last name; He‚Äôs the Lord Jesus Christ. **But in reality when I say the Lord, you should put a comma there for Lord is not his name; it‚Äôs His title. The title that signifies my relationship to Him. <span style="color:#29a329;">He is my Lord, I am his slave; I am his servant, He is my Lord.</span>**

> Jas 2:20-26 James demonstrates from Scripture that genuine faith finds expression in action.
>
Jas 2:22 This verse explains Jas 2:21 so it won't be misunderstood: Abraham was not justified by <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">his actions</span> alone; instead, **his faith and his <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">actions</span> worked together**. This describes the full scope of Abraham's faithful response to God throughout his life (see Gen 12:1-4; 18:1-27).
> 
Jas 2:24 not by faith alone: That is, not like the demons who merely believe something is true (Jas 2:19), but by a belief that results in <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">generous deeds</span> like those of God himself (Jas 1:17). Though some have thought that this teaching contradicts what Paul taught, it does not. Paul does not speak against good deeds themselves, but about trying to receive forgiveness of sins through good deeds (Rom 3:28; Gal 2:16). Just as Paul understands that love and generosity necessarily issue from a true faith (Gal 5:6), so also James knows that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">good deeds</span> can result only from authentic faith that results in a commitment to God (Jas 2:18,26).
>
Jas 2:26 <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">Good works</span> are as necessary to **faith** as **breath** is to a physical body (Gen 2:7). We cannot have one without the other.

# [FaithLife Study Bible](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jas2.24)

> 2:24 justified Here, the Greek term dikaio≈ç means ‚Äúto vindicate‚Äù or ‚Äúto prove or demonstrate something to be true or just‚Äù (see Jas 2:21).
>
<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">by works</span> **and not by faith alone** James is not saying that people must perform works in order for God to accept them. Rather, he is asserting that an individual‚Äôs <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">true conversion will be justified by deeds</span> of Christian love; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">deeds are the proof of conversion</span> to other people, and they are the natural result of being faithful to God. Deeds demonstrate the validity of a person‚Äôs profession of faith.
>>
<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#C70039;">In the context of Romans and Galatians, ‚Äúworks‚Äù (erga) means being obedient to the Jewish law (Rom 3:20, 28; Gal 2:16; 3:10‚Äì12).</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">In the context of James, erga refers to showing one‚Äôs faith through doing good deeds.</span> Paul fights the idea that works are the way to be saved, arguing that no one can be saved by works, because all fall short. James is addressing the opposite problem: faith is being used as an excuse not to do any works (not to care for those on the underside of power). Paul also mentions this same problem, agreeing with James that salvation does not mean that Christians stop acting according to God‚Äôs standards and doing good by others (Rom 6:15‚Äì23). The ot law is not the way Christians come to salvation‚Äîsalvation comes through belief in God‚Äôs faithfulness shown through Christ‚Äôs death and resurrection‚Äîbut it does help Christians understand how to best treat other people.

<!-- The **evidence** of your repentance, which precedes your salvation by Grace, is proven by the way that you live (Mt 3:8). Works are the byproduct of salvation, not it's cause, which is by Grace alone.  -->
# True Disciple of Christ
- A <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#333399;">True Christian</span> is saved by Grace when they believed (Eph 2:8-9), and they are justified [made right] by faith (Ro 5:1 ESV; Gal. 3:24 ESV).
    - In other words, it's not by the works of <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#C70039;">Jewish law</span> that you're saved.
- A <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#333399;">True Christian</span> will receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit the moment they believe (Ro 8:9; 1Co 12:13; Eph 1:13-14).
    - This produces the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">fruit of the Holy Spirit</span> (Ga 5:22-23). This works in tandem with faith to <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">prove</span> that you're a <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#333399;">True Disciple</span> of Christ (John 15:8 ESV; Mt 3:8,10, Jas 2:24). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">Fruit refers to deeds</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#C70039;">not Jewish law</span> (Mt 3:10 [Faithlife](https://biblia.com/books/nlt/Mt3.10); Jas 2:24 [FaithLife](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jas2.24))
    - <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">deeds</span> that indicate a change of attitude (heart) on the part of John‚Äôs hearers. <sup>[Mt 3:8 [NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+3%3A8&version=NET)]</sup>
    - John calls for <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">action and true ethical change</span>; mere lip service will not do. <sup>[Mt 3:8 [Filament](https://amzn.to/3CcB5Cu)]</sup>
    - by their <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">fruits Refers to people‚Äôs deeds</span>‚Äîthe natural outcomes of their choices and inclinations.<sup>[Mt 7:16,21 [Faithlife](https://biblia.com/books/nlt/Mt7.16)]</sup>
    -  <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">Fruits</span>, repentance and righteous behavior <sup>[Mt. 7:16 [NOAB](https://amzn.to/3XGvXPg)]</sup>
- A <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#333399;">True Christian</span> does not **practice** sin (1Jn 3:9-10 NET; Gal. 5:19-21). 
    - They cannot live in a pattern of continual sin<sup>[ESVSB](https://amzn.to/3WsN0Uw)</sup>. There is in fact a <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#29a329;">habitual cessation</span> from sin, because God's seed [Holy Spirit<sup>[NOAB](https://amzn.to/3XGvXPg)</sup>] resides in him.
    - Seeds grow! Reminds me of the metaphor of trees that produce fruit.
- A <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#333399;">True Christian</span> can make mistakes (1Jn 1:8-10<sup>[ESVSB](https://amzn.to/3WsN0Uw)</sup>). 
    - This means that there **IS NOT** an <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#C70039;">absolute cessation</span> of sin. You will struggle against your sin nature (Gal 5:17; Rom. 7:15-25).

<!-- ; however, if you're truly saved, your salvation will produce fruit, that is good deeds, behavior, actions that prove you're a <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#333399;">True Disciple</span>. This is the natural work of God and not of yourselves. -->

<!-- If a Christian's life is devoid of the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">fruit</span> of the Holy spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21), they have likely fooled themselves (James 1:22), becoming false professors (2Pe 2:21-22). -->

<!-- In this article we examined the difference between lip service (Tit 1:16; Is 29:13; Mt 15:8) and justification. One path lead to the practice of sin (1Jn 3:9-10) and the other to soteriological sanctification (Phil 2:12).  -->

So in conclusion, let us not give unrepentant sinners false hope; rather, let us declare the whole counsel of God: *‚ÄúYou must be born again‚Äù* (Jn 3:7).

<!-- 

The evidence of your salvation by Grace (Eph 2:8-9) is proven by the way you live (Mt 3:8). Jesus taught that you could identify people by their fruit, that is by the way that they act (Matthew 7:16-21). -->
