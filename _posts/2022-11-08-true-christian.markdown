<div class="mt">TRUE CHRISTIANS DO NOT PRACTICE SIN</div>

<div class="mt" style="font-size:21px;">ÍßÅ 1 John 3:9-10 ÍßÇ</div>

The keyword here is <span style="font-size:24px;color:#595959;">practice</span>. A true Christian is incapable of practicing sin. Scholars have defined this as *"living in a continual pattern"*. This is not the same thing as making a mistake, this is talking about your habits and lifestyle.

> **3:8** The reason the Son of God appeared restates v. 1Jn 3:5 but here specifies the connection of sin to the devil. **Knowing Christ means becoming involved in an all-out war against the works of the devil, that is, the practice of sinning.** -->

> **3:9-10** ... In other words, because the Word is present in the believer‚Äôs heart through the work of the Spirit, the believer cannot keep on sinning. Thus the hearts of genuine Christians (those who are truly children of God) have been so transformed that **they cannot live in a pattern of continual sin**‚Äîthough this does not mean that Christians are ever completely free from sin in this life (see 1 John 1:8‚Äì10). By this it is evident. Or, as Jesus said of false prophets, *‚ÄúYou will recognize them by their fruits‚Äù* (Matt. 7:16).

> b. 1 John 3:9 **tn** The problem of the present tense of œÄŒøŒπŒµ·øñ (poiei) here is exactly that of the present tense of ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒµŒπ (hamartanei) in 1Jn 3:6. **Here in 3:9 the distinction is sharply drawn between ‚Äúthe one who practices sin‚Äù in 3:8, who is of the devil, and ‚Äúthe one who is fathered by God‚Äù in 3:9**, who ‚Äúdoes not practice sin.‚Äù See S. Kubo (‚ÄúI John 3:9: **Absolute or Habitual?**‚Äù AUSS 7 [1969]: 47-56) for a fuller discussion of the author‚Äôs argument as based on a **sharp antithesis between the recipients (true Christians) and the opponents (heretics)**. ...

# [Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary](https://www.biblehub.com/commentaries/1_john/3-9.htm)

> **He that abides in Christ, continues not in the practice of sin. Renouncing sin is the great proof of spiritual union with, continuance in, and saving knowledge of the Lord Christ.**

# Chuck Smith C2000

> 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don‚Äôt know Him. I really haven‚Äôt seen Him. If I really know Him, then I‚Äôm gonna be free from the practice of sin.**

> 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. So again, don‚Äôt deceive yourself. <span style="color:#e65c00;">If you are **practicing** sin, living in sin, you are not of God</span>; you are a part of that rebellion against God, led by Satan.

<!-- > But don‚Äôt just listen to God‚Äôs word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves. &mdash; James 1:22

Being doers of the word, and not hearers only is the only proper response to the Word of God (not only the gospel but the entirety of Scripture), allowing it to take root in one‚Äôs life (cf. v. 21).

Doers of the Word. Hearing the word without action is self-deceptive, while hearing that results in doing the word is a blessing.
