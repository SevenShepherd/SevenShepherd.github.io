<div class="mt">TRUE CHRISTIANS DO NOT PRACTICE SIN</div>

<div class="mt" style="font-size:21px;">ÍßÅ 1 John 3:9-10 ÍßÇ</div>

The keyword here is <span style="font-size:24px;color:#595959;">practice</span>. A true Christian is incapable of practicing sin. Scholars have defined this as *"living in a continual pattern"*. **This is not the same thing as making a mistake.** This is talking about your habits and lifestyle.

> **3:9-10** ... In other words, because the Word is present in the believer‚Äôs heart through the work of the Spirit, **the believer cannot keep on sinning**. Thus the hearts of genuine Christians (those who are truly children of God) have been so transformed that **they cannot live in a pattern of continual sin**‚Äîthough this does not mean that Christians are ever completely free from sin in this life (see 1 John 1:8‚Äì10). By this it is evident. Or, as Jesus said of false prophets, *‚ÄúYou will recognize them by their fruits‚Äù* (Matt. 7:16).

# Chuck Smith C2000

> 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don‚Äôt know Him. I really haven‚Äôt seen Him. If I really know Him, then I‚Äôm gonna be free from the practice of sin.**

> 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

# Dr. Jack Van Impe

Jack Van Impe makes and interesting statement which raises an important question. Are "Believers" who continue to practice sin, the "ashamed," at Christs coming, or were they never "True Believers" to begin with?

> There is no sin that can keep a **true believer** out of [Heaven](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/heaven/). God's Word clearly states that some Christians will be saved *"so as by fire."* They lose everything except their salvation. Because of it they will be *"ashamed"* in Christ's presence (1Jn 2:28 KJV).<sup style="font-size:10px;">[JVI]</sup>
>
If believers were left behind at the Rapture because of some sin in their lives, who would the *"ashamed"* be at that investigative session? Rewards are lost because of disobedience and disobedience is a sin (Ro 5:19; James 5:17).<sup style="font-size:10px;">[JVI]</sup>

**The evidence of your salvation by Grace (Eph 2:8-9) is proven by the way you live (Mt 3:8 NLT). Jesus taught that you will know His true followers by their fruit (Matthew 7:16-21).** This is how we know it wasn't just lip service (Tit 1:16; Is 29:13 NLT; Mt 15:8 NLT) when we asked God into our hearts. The Bible teaches that you will be able to identify a true Christian by their fruit, that is by the way that they act (Mt 7:16 NLT).

The Bible goes even further and adds that not only should we be showing evidence of our salvation by grace through how we live our lives, but that if we don't we're in danger! The Bible says that we should test ourselves to see if we're truly in the faith (2 Cor. 13:5).

> **7:21‚Äì23** The kingdom community must guard against not only false prophets (vv. 15‚Äì20) but also false disciples. Lord, Lord. **An oral confession of Jesus as Lord does not always indicate a repentant heart.**

> **7:23** then will I declare to them. Jesus says that he will one day exercise the prerogative of condemning people to hell, something that only God can do (cf. note on John 5:22). Though these condemned prophets appeared to belong to Jesus, they were **never truly saved**, for Jesus never knew them (cf. note on Matt. 7:21‚Äì23).

<!-- A true believer is someone who has truly repented of their sins and turned to God. They do not make a **practice** of sin (1Jn 3:9-10 ESV; Gal 5:19-21 NLT), and their life is filled with the fruit of the spirit (Gal 5:22-23). The Bible makes it clear that everyone receives the Holy Spirit the moment he or she believes in Jesus Christ (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 1:13-14). -->

> b. Jude 1:1 **tn** **For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege.** It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were ‚Äúservants (or slaves) of the Lord.‚Äù

> b. Revelation 1:1 **tn** Grk ‚Äúslaves.‚Äù Although this translation frequently renders Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ (doulos) as ‚Äúslave,‚Äù **the connotation is often of one who has sold himself into slavery; in a spiritual sense, the idea is that of becoming a slave of God or of Jesus Christ voluntarily.** The voluntary notion is conspicuous here; hence, the translation ‚Äúservants.‚Äù In any case, **the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another.** BDAG notes that ‚Äú‚Äòservant‚Äô for ‚Äòslave‚Äô is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times‚Ä¶in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished‚Äù (BDAG 260 s.v.). **A good translation is ‚Äúbondservant‚Äù** (sometimes found in the ASV for Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ), **in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another.** But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.

# Legacy Standard Bible (LSB) FAQ
131 Scholars including it's derived [NASB ‚Äò95 & ‚Äò77](https://www.lockman.org/new-american-standard-bible-nasb/), otherwise [70+ scholars](https://lsbible.org/faqs/). The Legacy Standard Bible is a worthy update to the NASB '95, which was already considered by scholars as the most accurate version of the Bible ever produced.

> Why does the LSB translate ‚Äúdoulos‚Äù as ‚Äúslave‚Äù?
>
The NT has a variety of terms that refer to the individuals who serve under the authority of another. Doulos denotes a very specific form of servitude: slavery. **The NT uses doulos to describe an individual who is totally subordinate to a master (cf. Matt 8:9 LSB; Matt 24:46 LSB; 2 Pet 2:19 LSB) and even owned by that master (Phile 1:16-19 LSB)**, in contrast to one who is freed (Gal 3:28 LSB). For this reason, the NASB already translated the vast majority of this term as slave. The LSB made this consistent, which brings out how believers are to relate to Christ. **He is our Lord and master (2 Cor 4:5 LSB), and we are His slaves (Rom 1:1 LSB; Phil 1:1 LSB). This underscores His great redemption in buying believers from slavery to sin (Rom 6:16 LSB). This also underscores the believer‚Äôs absolute surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom 6:16-17 LSB).** A consistent translation of doulos, in effect, sharpens the very nature of the Christian life.

# Chuck Smith C2000
> Jesus on another occasion said, "Why do you call me Lord and yet you don‚Äôt do the things that I command you?" You see, our problem is that we‚Äôve come to think of the term "Lord" as a name and so we say, "The Lord Jesus Christ" and we think of Lord as His first name, Jesus His middle name and Christ His last name; He‚Äôs the Lord Jesus Christ. **But in reality when I say the Lord, you should put a comma there for Lord is not his name; it‚Äôs His title. The title that signifies my relationship to Him. <span style="color:#29a329;">He is my Lord, I am his slave; I am his servant, He is my Lord.</span>**
