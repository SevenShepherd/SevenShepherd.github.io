<div class="mt">TRUE CHRISTIANS DO NOT PRACTICE SIN</div>

<div class="mt" style="font-size:21px;">ÍßÅ 1 John 3:9-10 ÍßÇ</div>

The keyword here is <span style="font-size:24px;color:#595959;">practice</span>. A true Christian is incapable of practicing sin. Scholars have defined this as *"living in a continual pattern"*. **This is not the same thing as making a mistake.** This is talking about your habits and lifestyle.

> **3:9-10** ... In other words, because the Word is present in the believer‚Äôs heart through the work of the Spirit, the believer cannot keep on sinning. Thus the hearts of genuine Christians (those who are truly children of God) have been so transformed that **they cannot live in a pattern of continual sin**‚Äîthough this does not mean that Christians are ever completely free from sin in this life (see 1 John 1:8‚Äì10). By this it is evident. Or, as Jesus said of false prophets, *‚ÄúYou will recognize them by their fruits‚Äù* (Matt. 7:16).

# [Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary](https://www.biblehub.com/commentaries/1_john/3-9.htm)

> **He that abides in Christ, continues not in the practice of sin. Renouncing sin is the great proof of spiritual union with, continuance in, and saving knowledge of the Lord Christ.**

# Chuck Smith C2000

> 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don‚Äôt know Him. I really haven‚Äôt seen Him. If I really know Him, then I‚Äôm gonna be free from the practice of sin.**

> 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. So again, don‚Äôt deceive yourself. <span style="color:#C70039;">If you are **practicing** sin, living in sin, you are not of God; you are a part of that rebellion against God, led by Satan.</span>

There is no sin that can keep a **true believer** out of [Heaven](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/heaven/). God's Word clearly states that some Christians will be saved *"so as by fire."* They lose everything except their salvation. Because of it they will be *"ashamed"* in Christ's presence (1Jn 2:28 NKJV).<sup style="font-size:10px;">[JVI]</sup>

If believers were left behind at the Rapture because of some sin in their lives, who would the *"ashamed"* be at that investigative session? Rewards are lost because of disobedience and disobedience is a sin (Ro 5:19; James 5:17).<sup style="font-size:10px;">[JVI]</sup>
