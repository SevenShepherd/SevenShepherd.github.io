This article compares the minds of a few intellectual titans, in an attempt to resolve once and for all, the conditionality or unconditionality of the doctrine of election. The verses I'd like to cover are as follows: Acts 13:48,2:23; Mt 22:14; Eph 1:4,11; Jn 15:16,18-19; Jn 6:44,65; Ro 8:29-30; 9:11-16; 1 Pe 1:2; Re 13:8; Lk 24:45; Jn 17:9, and Ro 10:9 + 1 Cor 12:3.

I've included some definitions of faith to show that no one disagrees on what genuine faith looks like. The question, instead, is about what this genuine faith is based upon. Is election based upon God's foreknowledge of our faith, or does God grant faith to those whom He elects unconditionally, and arbitrarily, without regard for foreseen human faith?

Dr. Lennox holds to a systemless theology, but defends a Wesleyan foreknowledge view on election; Dr. Geisler represents a sublapsarian, Amyraldian, moderate 4-Point Calvinist view; while Drs. Grudem & Packer represent an infralapsarian, Othodox 5-Point Calvinist view. They all agree on what faith looks like, but disagree upon what it is based upon.

- <a name="faith_lennox" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.1 The Definition Of Faith According To Lennox</a>

    > According to the Oxford English Dictionary the word ‚Äúfaith‚Äù derives from the Latin fides (from which we get ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù), so its basic meaning is ‚Äútrust‚Äù or ‚Äúreliance‚Äù. The Greek etymological equivalent is pistis, which is found in the New Testament where it has the following principal senses:
    >
    1. belief, trust;
    2. that which produces belief, evidence, token, pledge, engagement;
    3. trust in its objective aspect, troth, observance of trust, fidelity.
    >
    So the main dictionary meanings given to ‚Äúfaith‚Äù are: belief, trust, confidence, reliance, and belief proceeding from testimony or authority. It is to be strongly affirmed that the faith in God described in the Bible is ‚Äúreliance and belief proceeding from testimony or authority‚Äù. **Biblical faith is evidence-based.** &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*](). p. 136.

    --

    > **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing. One of its evidences is a deepening commitment to the word of Christ. A disciple is a learner. The hallmark of a true disciple is a readiness to learn more and more of the truth, thereby discovering that knowledge of truth leads to freedom. Genuine faith perseveres. &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*](). On John 8:31‚Äì47. p. 218.

    --

    > A second way of knowing that we have eternal life is **by observing the spiritual and moral outworking of our faith in our behaviour**:
    >> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. The man who says, ‚ÄúI know him,‚Äù but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. (1 John 2:3‚Äì4.)
    >
    >>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death. (1 John 3:14.)
    >
    Jesus made a similar point when he said, **by their fruit you will recognise them (Matthew 7:20)**. **If there is no moral consistency between our lives and our professed belief in God, then our claim to know God will not be credible.** It is in this context that Peter exhorts his readers to make your calling and election sure by our development of Christian character and moral virtues. The phrase ‚Äúmaking sure‚Äù means ‚Äúconfirming‚Äù. That is, the development of visible Christian moral virtues in **a person‚Äôs life confirms the genuineness of their claim to be believers. True faith in God will be evidenced by its moral consequences in the life of a believer.** &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*](). p. 313.

- <a name="faith_grudem" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.2 The Definition Of Faith According To Grudem</a>

    Knowledge about the facts of Jesus's life, death, burial, and bodily resurrection on it's own is not sufficient for saving faith. Saving faith includes knowledge, approval, and personal trust. You can read the full description [here](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#grudem).

    > I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D., Westminster), "Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel. p. 71.

- <a name="faith_packer" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.3 The Definition Of Faith According To Packer</a>

    Saving faith is composed of three essential elements: notitia, assensus, and fiducia. As Packer points out in Concise Theology: "Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14)." 
    
    The latin term notitia means 'knowledge' and refers to an "acquaintance with the content of the gospel"; assensus or ‚Äòagreement‚Äô means "recognition that the gospel is true"; fiducia means ‚Äòtrust and reliance‚Äô and it speaks of the "personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one‚Äôs own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3."

    > Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism. Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‚Äòfaith apart from observing the law‚Äô, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But if ‚Äògood works‚Äô (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, justifying faith (fiducia) is not yet ours. ‚Äî Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford), Concise Theology. pp. 173-175.

- <a name="faith_geisler" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.4 The Definition Of Faith According To Geisler</a>

    > 1 John 3:9 John affirmed that ‚Äúno one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God‚Äôs seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.‚Äù <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color:orangered;">This confirms moderate Calvinism</span></span>‚Äôs view of eternal security for two reasons. First, anyone truly born of God cannot persist in evil. **If someone does, then he is not born of God.** That is, a Christian‚Äôs perseverance in avoiding continual, habitual sin is a proof of his salvation &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Systematic Theology Vol. 3 Sin & Salvation. Ch. 11.

    > As Ryrie put it, "**Saving faith is a working faith**, and those works justify believers in the courtroom on earth," and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">an "unproductive faith is a spurious faith."</span> &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Four Views On Eternal Security. p. 107. <sup style="color:#A8A8A8;"><sup>45</sup>Ryrie, So GreatSalvation, 110-11.</sup>

    > As Charles Ryrie correctly observed, <span style="font-weight:bold;">"every Christian will bear fruit; <span style="color:orangered;">otherwise he or she is not a true believer."</span></span> For 'fruit, then, furnishes evidence of saving faith. The evidence may be strong or weak, erratic or regular, visible or not. But a **saving faith works**," &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Four Views On Eternal Security. p. 105.

    > Since saving faith is an act of trust in and obedience to Jesus Christ regarding the gospel, it is evident from its very essence that **saving faith (which <span style="color:orangered;">involves repentance</span>) will naturally tend to produce good works**‚Äîa nominal, noncommittal, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">purely intellectual-type faith will not</span>. Therefore, whereas <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">we are saved by faith alone, saving faith is not alone</span> but is inclined to produce good works. &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler

    ![Foreknowledge](/assets/images/greek/proginosko.png)

    Both Drs. Lennox & Grudem believe that salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but they also agree that [the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/).
    
    <!-- They both acknowledge that faith "results" in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10), that Faith is a trust and reliance in Christ for salvation, which is juxtaposed to the false teaching that it's a minor opinion change or an intellectual assent to facts, which is not salvific (James 2:19). -->

    > For instance, J. I. Packer and O. R. Johnson in their introduction to Luther‚Äôs Bondage of the Will say that, in Reformed eyes, ‚Äúto rely on oneself for faith is no different in principle from relying on oneself for works‚Äù. 89 **Wayne Grudem similarly writes: ‚ÄúElection based on something good in us (our faith) would be the beginning of salvation by merit.‚Äù** 90 The only way out of this, he argues, is to hold that faith itself must be a gift of God distributed according to his sovereign will, completely independent of any attitude, desire, or behaviour on the part of those he elects to save. This view, as we have seen, is called ‚Äúunconditional election‚Äù ‚Äì an expression that does not actually appear in Scripture itself. &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*](). p. 130.


    **There is NO disagreement on what genuine faith looks like**, but rather upon what it is based; (1) God grants faith to those whom He elects unconditionally, and arbitrarily, without regard for foreseen human faith. (2) We're elected according to His foreknowledge of who would have faith. The question then becomes: If we view our election in the second sense, is election by faith the beginning of salvation by merit?

# Will only those elected to salvation believe or does God elect unto salvation based upon his foreknowledge of your faith?

There are many verses that prove that election is in the Bible, so it's not a matter of whether or not Christians believe in predestination, we all do, it's a matter of how we understand how election is applied to believers, that differs.
