This article compares the minds of a few intellectual titans, in an attempt to resolve once and for all, the conditionality or unconditionality of the doctrine of election. The verses I'd like to cover are as follows: Acts 13:48,2:23; Mt 22:14; Eph 1:4,11; Jn 15:16,18-19; Jn 6:44,65; Ro 8:29-30; 9:11-16; 1 Pe 1:2; 2 Pe 1:10; Re 13:8; Lk 24:45 + 1 Cor 2:14; Jn 17:9, and Ro 10:9 + 1 Cor 12:3.

I've included some definitions of faith to show that no one disagrees on what genuine faith looks like. The question, instead, is about what this genuine faith is based upon. Is election based upon God's foreknowledge of our faith, or does God grant faith to those whom He elects unconditionally, and arbitrarily, without regard for foreseen human faith?

<!-- what this genuine faith is based upon -->

Dr. Lennox holds to a systemless theology, but defends a Wesleyan foreknowledge view on election; Dr. Geisler represents a sublapsarian, Amyraldian, moderate 4-Point Calvinist view; while Drs. Grudem & Packer represent an infralapsarian, Orthodox 5-Point Calvinist view. They all agree on what faith looks like, but disagree upon what it is based upon.

> According to the Oxford English Dictionary the word ‚Äúfaith‚Äù derives from the Latin fides (from which we get ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù), so its basic meaning is ‚Äútrust‚Äù or ‚Äúreliance‚Äù.

1. belief, trust;
2. that which produces belief, evidence, token, pledge, engagement;
3. trust in its objective aspect, troth, observance of trust, fidelity.

So the main dictionary meanings given to ‚Äúfaith‚Äù are: belief, trust, confidence, reliance, and belief proceeding from testimony or authority.

    Knowledge about the facts of Jesus's life, death, burial, and bodily resurrection on it's own is not sufficient for saving faith. Saving faith includes knowledge, approval, and personal trust. You can read the full description [here](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#grudem).

    > I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ...

    You can read more [here](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#packer).

    Saving faith is composed of three essential elements: notitia, assensus, and fiducia. As Packer points out in Concise Theology: "Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14)." 
    
    The latin term notitia means 'knowledge' and refers to an "acquaintance with the content of the gospel"; assensus or ‚Äòagreement‚Äô means "recognition that the gospel is true"; fiducia means ‚Äòtrust and reliance‚Äô and it speaks of the "personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one‚Äôs own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3."

    > **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.** Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‚Äòfaith apart from observing the law‚Äô, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">if ‚Äògood works‚Äô (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith</span>, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">justifying faith (fiducia) is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not yet ours</span></span>. &mdash; [Concise Theology.

- <a name="faith_basis" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.5 What Is The Basis Of Genuine Faith?</a>

    ![Foreknowledge](/assets/images/greek/proginosko.png)

    As we've seen, **there is NO disagreement on what genuine faith looks like**, all of the aforementioned scholars hold to the complete definition of the protestant [sola fide](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/); however, the question remains: what is the basis of genuine faith? Is election based upon God's foreknowledge of our faith, or does God grant faith to those whom He elects unconditionally, and arbitrarily, without regard for foreseen human faith?
    
    <!-- what genuine faith is based? -->

    <!-- believe that salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but they also agree that [the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). -->

    <!-- , but rather upon what it is based; (1) God grants faith to those whom He elects unconditionally, and arbitrarily, without regard for foreseen human faith. (2) We're elected according to His foreknowledge of who would have faith. The question then becomes: If we view our election in the second sense, is election by faith the beginning of salvation by merit? -->

    
    > For instance, J. I. Packer and O. R. Johnson in their introduction to Luther‚Äôs Bondage of the Will say that, in Reformed eyes, ‚Äúto rely on oneself for faith is no different in principle from relying on oneself for works‚Äù. 89 **Wayne Grudem similarly writes: ‚ÄúElection based on something good in us (our faith) would be the beginning of salvation by merit.‚Äù** 90 The only way out of this, he argues, is to hold that faith itself must be a gift of God distributed according to his sovereign will, completely independent of any attitude, desire, or behaviour on the part of those he elects to save. This view, as we have seen, is called ‚Äúunconditional election‚Äù ‚Äì an expression that does not actually appear in Scripture itself. 
    >
    &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*](). p. 130.

    The challenge has been made by 5-Point Calvinists (Drs. Grudem & Packer) that election based upon God's foreknowledge of who would believe before the foundation of the world, would somehow be equivalent to merit. Lennox, however, points out that there's a flaw in their reasoning surrounding the nature of faith and the word "good."
    
    > We first explore the idea that, if people had the capacity to believe in God, if they were capable of faith, their faith would itself be a meritorious work contributing to salvation. May I dare to suggest that **this view arises from confusion about the nature of faith itself?**
    > 
    Some of the confusion arises from overlooking a simple logical point: ***meriting something, and having to do something to obtain that thing, are not the same.***
    >
    &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*](). pp. 132-139.

    Dr. Lennox goes on to give two good examples of how meriting something, and having to do something to obtain that thing, are not the same.

    > For instance, a distant relative may leave me a considerable sum in her will. I have done nothing to deserve it. She has gifted it to me as set out in a document held by her solicitor. He sends me a letter informing me of the fact. Now I have to decide whether I trust him and, indeed, her. I have to respond or I will not receive it. I could reject it. Clearly, the fact that I have to do something to make it my own does not mean that I have merited it or contributed to it in any way.
    >
    It is surely for that reason that our Lord can say to a woman on one occasion: Your faith has saved you; go in peace (Luke 7:50).
    >
    Consistent with this, when Paul is asked by a jailer at Philippi, who has just been terrified by an earthquake that freed the prisoners, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?, Paul does not understand the jailer to be asking how he can merit salvation. He does not respond by suggesting that the jailer can do nothing in view of the fact that his salvation depends entirely on the sovereign choice of God. On the contrary, he tells the jailer exactly what he is able to do ‚Äì and should do: Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved ‚Äì you and your household (see Acts 16:25‚Äì34). 

    Dr. Lennox then turns his attention back to Dr. Grudem's specific use of the adjective "good."

    > Wayne Grudem, cited just above, says: ‚ÄúElection based on something good in us (our faith) would be the beginning of salvation by merit.‚Äù What is striking here is the use of the adjective ‚Äúgood‚Äù used to qualify ‚Äúfaith‚Äù which is then linked with ‚Äúmerit‚Äù. But does Scripture teach that faith is a good thing in this meritorious sense? I think not.

    Lennox then goes on to explain, that Paul regarded faith, the act of believing, as the opposite of merit. By examining Romans 4:3,4-5,22, we can deduce that the personal act of believing in or trusting Christ for salvation is not a meritorious action that contributes to salvation. Salvation is all of God.

    > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> For what does the Scripture say? ‚Äú**Abraham believed God**, and it was counted to him as righteousness.‚Äù ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> And to the one who **does not work** but **believes in** [trusts, [pisteu√≥](https://biblehub.com/greek/4100.htm)] him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> That is why **his faith** was ‚Äúcounted to him as righteousness.‚Äù &mdash; Romans 4:3,4-5,22 ESV

    Dr. Lennox then brings our attention to the fact, that the faith was Abraham‚Äôs ‚Äì his faith, and that the text does not say here that God ‚Äúgave him the faith.‚Äù

    > Please note that the faith was Abraham‚Äôs ‚Äì his faith. The text does not say here that God ‚Äúgave him the faith‚Äù (though we shall consider below how faith may be ‚Äúgiven‚Äù), nor does it say that Abraham‚Äôs faith was a meritorious contribution to his justification; it doesn‚Äôt even say here that Christ‚Äôs righteousness was imputed (reckoned) to Abraham as righteousness. No, Scripture says that it was Abraham‚Äôs faith that was reckoned to him as righteousness.
    >
    Paul is using the concept of work here as an activity that merits wages. Faith in God, he says, is not like that at all: it is not to be taken as a meritorious action repaid by the reward of salvation ‚Äì otherwise the person who has faith would be working.
    >
    Paul, then, is contrasting two possible actions or attitudes ‚Äì working and trusting ‚Äì on the basis of the tacit assumption that everyone is capable of performing both.

    At this point I would have considered Dr. Lennox to be the winner with the extraordinary weapon that is Romans 4:4-5. It does in fact prove that trusting in Christ is not a work, and that Grudem's use of the adjective ‚Äúgood‚Äù used to qualify ‚Äúfaith‚Äù which is then linked with ‚Äúmerit‚Äù is incorrect; however, in order to close this case it would have to pass one more issue. 

    > 29 Jesus answered them, ‚Äú**This is the work of God, that you believe** in him whom he has sent.‚Äù &mdash; Jn 6:29 ESV
    >
    29 For **it has been granted to you** that for the sake of Christ you should not only **believe in him** but also suffer for his sake, &mdash;  Phil 1:29 ESV
    >
    8 For by grace you have been saved through **faith**. And this is not your own doing; **it is the gift of God**, 9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast. &mdash; Eph 2:8-9 ESV

    The verses of Jn 6:29; Phil 1:29; Eph 2:8-9 seem to suggest that even if faith isn't a work, it was God's doing, gifted, or granted. This poses a dilemma. 

    > In spite of the fact that Scripture explicitly says that it is Abraham‚Äôs faith that is credited to him as righteousness, it will be objected that Paul explicitly says elsewhere that faith is a gift of God. The relevant passage is Ephesians 2:8‚Äì9 ...
    >
    ... However, in the Greek text the word for faith is feminine in gender, whereas the word for it (in the phrase it is the gift of God) is neuter. From a grammatical point of view it is therefore not faith that is the gift ‚Äì **the gift is salvation by grace**. Paul is in fact here making the same point as in Romans 4, contrasting salvation by merit with salvation by grace through faith.

    Dr. Lennox is successful at marking Ephesians 2:8-9 off the list, but does not address the other two verses, that I have supplied. It's still possible that faith is granted and not our doing. He admits to some degree that this may be the case in a certain sense.

    > There is a real sense in which faith can be seen to be a gift of God without denying it is also our faith. ... Similarly in the marriage relationship, the trust, faith, and commitment of each partner is drawn out by the other. And that does not alter the fact that the faith of each partner is their own subjective response to the other ‚Äì it is their faith.
    >
    In that sense we can certainly regard faith as a gift of God. God draws it out of us by his grace and love. If God did not initiate it himself, we would never experience it. But he regards the faith as ours ‚Äì just as he did with Abraham.

- <a name="faith_choice" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.6 Predestination Based On Foreknowledge Of Faith Still Does Not Give People Free Choice?</a>

    When Dr. Grudem claims that those who hold to the Wesleyan foreknowledge position, don't have free will either, he also inadvertently admits that this position abides by the teachings of God's sovereignty. To which I would reply, good! That still does not invalidate the position. So not only does Romans 4:4-5 prove that trusting in Christ (faith), is not a meritorious work, but inadvertently, according to Grudem, it's also a position that upholds God's Sovereignty.

    > The idea that God‚Äôs predestination of some to believe is based on foreknowledge of their faith encounters still another problem: upon reflection, **this system turns out to give no real freedom to man either. For if God can look into the future and see that person A will come to faith in Christ, and that person B will not come to faith in Christ, then those facts are already fixed, they are already determined**. If we assume that God‚Äôs knowledge of the future is true (which it must be), then it is absolutely certain that person A will believe and person B will not. There is no way that their lives could turn out any differently than this. Therefore it is fair to say that their destinies are still determined, for they could not be otherwise. &mdash; Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster Theological Seminary), Systematic Theology, Chapter 32: Election and Reprobation. pp. 827.<sup><a name="grudem" href="#contents">2</a></sup>

- <a name="Acts2:23" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em"> üìú 1.6.1 Christ's Predestined Crucifixion (Acts 2:23)</a>

    > 23 this man, who was **handed over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God**, you executed by nailing him to a cross at the hands of Gentiles. &mdash; Acts 2:23 NET

    Dr. Lennox actually addresses this indirectly when he addresses the culpability of those involved in Christ's predestined crucifixion (Acts 2:23 NET).

    > Is God‚Äôs foreknowledge causative ‚Äì i.e. **does the fact that God knows that something will happen cause it to happen**, and therefore relieve any participant from responsibility? **Surely the answer is: not necessarily**; if for no other reason than the fact that the Bible itself does not regard God‚Äôs foreknowledge or predestination as diminishing human responsibility.
    >
    The very first quote under ‚Äúforeknowledge‚Äù (which is the same as the second quote under ‚Äúpredestination‚Äù) says that **Christ‚Äôs crucifixion was both foreknown and predestined**, but that the men involved in it were wicked and therefore **morally responsible**. One could add to this that the death of Christ was actually predicted in Scripture centuries before it happened. However, **Scripture itself tells us that this fact does not diminish the culpability of those involved** in crucifying the Lord.
    >
    ... Of course on the human level foreknowledge ‚Äì knowing something in advance ‚Äì is not necessarily causative. ...
    >
    &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*](). p. 109.

    Lennox then points out the fatal flaw of all man made theologies, and that is how they never take into the account that God lives outside of time. Not too long before reading Lennox's book, I came to the conclusion that If God lives outside of time, even at this moment, he could elect someone, and it still count as before time began because God lives outside of time itself.

    > At the higher level there is another consideration. The idea that, because God knows about an event beforehand it must be predetermined, may rest on the assumption that God‚Äôs relationship with time is the same as ours; that he sits, as we do, on a time line that stretches from the past to the future. However, Scripture indicates that God‚Äôs relationship to time is not at all like ours. Jesus said, before Abraham was, I am (John 8:58 ESV). It could be, for instance, that **God knew beforehand that I would trust Christ simply because he sees it in an eternal perspective, so that the issue of causation does not even arise**. 
    >
    We need, however, to be cautious here. Time is not an easy concept ‚Äì indeed, no one admits to understanding what it actually is. It would therefore be wise to be skeptical of interpretations of God‚Äôs foreknowledge that deny the freedom that, according to Scripture elsewhere, is possessed by the men and women God has created.
    >
    &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*](). p. 110.

    You can always tell when a theology neglects this fact when they say things like "God looked forward through time," as if God experiences the flow of time like human beings, which he clearly does not.

- <a name="faith_analysis" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">1.7 Conclusions</a>

    <!-- I would say that both sides of the debate are safe to land on, seeing as how the use of the adjective ‚Äúgood‚Äù used to qualify ‚Äúfaith‚Äù which is then linked with ‚Äúmerit‚Äù is incorrect. It looks as though the answer to whether or not election by faith is the beginning of salvation by merit would be false. On whether faith is a universal God-given ability, it's possible; it's also possible that God grants faith still, or perhaps like Lennox suggests, its both. -->

    By examining Romans 4:3,4-5,22, specifically verse 5 (Ro 4:5), we can deduce that the personal act of believing in or trusting Christ for salvation is not a meritorious action that contributes to salvation. So no, **election by faith is not the beginning of salvation by merit**.

    It does, in fact, prove that **trusting in Christ (faith), is not a meritorious work**, and that Grudem's use of the adjective "good," used to qualify "faith," which is then linked with "merit," is an incorrect take on the Wesleyan stance.

    The main takeaway for me, is that it is not meritorious or legalistic to hold to a foreknowledge view, though, this is not indisputable proof that this is how God decreed things, only that it isn't unsafe.

    So Lennox does disprove Grudem's claim, but does not prove empirically, that the foreknowledge view is what God decreed, only that it is a safe view to hold, as a moderate, independent from any theology.

    On whether faith is a universal God-given ability, it's possible; it's also possible that God grants faith still, or perhaps like Lennox suggests, its both in a certain sense.

<a name="false_dichotomy" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">üí° 2. Infralapsarianism v. Wesleyanism, A False Dichotomy?</a>

The debate in the last section may have cleared the Wesleyan foreknowledge view of any meritorious working, but perhaps we've been so distracted as not to notice other options? In this section I'd like to look at alternatives to the two views debated in the last section, to see if perhaps, the true answer may be none of the above.

![The Order Of God's Decrees](/assets/images/decrees.png)

> The term supralapsarian is from the Latin supra (above) and lapsus (fall), meaning that God‚Äôs decree of election (predestination) is considered by supralapsarians to be above, or logically prior to, His decree to permit the Fall. Since infra means ‚Äúbelow,‚Äù the infralapsarians consider God‚Äôs decree of election to be beneath, or logically after, His decree to permit the Fall. The sublapsarians (Amyraldians) <sup>9</sup> are similar to the infralapsarians, except they place God‚Äôs order to provide salvation before His order to elect (see Chafer, ST, 2.105). Wesleyans adhere to the same basic order as infralapsarians, except they hold that God‚Äôs election is based on His foreknowledge rather than simply in accord with it. Hence, for Wesleyans (Arminians), God‚Äôs decree is conditional instead of unconditional (which is maintained by the three Calvinistic views).
>
Supralapsarians are hypter-Calvinists, being double-predestinarians. <sup>10</sup> Infralapsarians are strong Calvinists but are not double-predestinarians. Sublapsarians (Amyraldians) are moderate Calvinists, holding to unlimited atonement. Again, Wesleyans are Arminians, insisting that election is conditional, not unconditional. Wesleyans also do not believe in eternal security, <sup>11</sup> while adherents to the other views do.

There is a simpler chart provided by R.C. Sproul, who simplifies the difference between supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism into an asymmetrical and symmetrical view. It would seem that Hyper-Calvinism (supralapsarianism) is rightly rejected by all sides of the debate about God's decrees, because of the egregious violence it does to God's character in insinuating that He could possibly coerce sin.

|Scholastic Calvinism (Infra.)|Hyper-Calvinism (Supra.)|

|God passes over the reprobate|God works unbelief in the hearts of the reprobate.|

> The dreadful error of hyper-Calvinism is that it involves God in coercing sin. This does radical violence to the integrity of God‚Äôs character. &mdash; [Dr. R. C. Sproul (Ph.D., Whitefield)](https://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q), "Chosen by God," Ch. 7. Sproul was a devout <span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">5-point Scholastic Calvinist</span>

- <a name="vessels" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">üìú 2.2.1 The Vessels Of Wrath (Romans 9:22-24)</a>

    > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience <span style="font-weight:bold;">vessels of wrath prepared for destruction</span>, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> in order <span style="font-weight:bold;">to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy</span>, which he has prepared beforehand for glory‚Äî <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? &mdash; Romans 9:22-24 ESV

    There are many good points made by Lennox on this subject, but the one that stood out to me was Ephesians 2:3‚Äì4. These verses seem to prove that there's no fixed vessel of wrath from the beginning, invalidating Hyper-Calvinism (Supra.) at the very least.

    > There are some who take these texts to mean that in eternity God mysteriously or even arbitrarily chose who was to be a vessel of wrath and who was to be a vessel of mercy; and that choice permanently and unconditionally fixes their destinies. There is a fundamental flaw in this reasoning, even apart from the fact that it makes no moral sense. **The flaw is to assume that, if someone is a vessel of wrath, they can never become a vessel of mercy.** But **that is false**, as Jeremiah‚Äôs use of the potter analogy indicates. **Paul was a vessel of wrath who became a vessel of mercy.** Also, in Ephesians, Paul describes the believers as having once been children of wrath, but because they had repented and trusted Christ as Saviour and Lord they had become vessels of mercy (see Ephesians 2:3‚Äì4). &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*](). p. 272.


- <a name="infra" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">2.3 Why Sublapsarianism May Be Superior To Infralapsarianism</a>

    I recently composed [a small article](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/) on why I reject limited atonement in favor of unlimited atonement. While the reason for crossing supralapsarianism off the list is somewhat obvious, the reason why I'm crossing infralapsarianism off the list is over verses that conflict with limited atonement.

    - The Bible does not support limited atonement (1 Jn 2:2, etc.)
    - St. Augustine and virtually every other church father did not hold to limited atonement.
    - Luther, & John Calvin himself did not hold to limited atonement either.

    <!--  -->

    That leaves the rest of this debate between Moderate Calvinism / Amyraldism (sublapsarianism) & Moderate Arminianism (wesleyan foreknowledge).

- <a name="sub" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em">2.4 Conclusions</a>

    > In sum, regarding the question, For whom did Christ die? we find biblical warrant for dividing the question into God‚Äôs purpose regarding the provision of the Atonement and his purpose concerning the application thereof. **Scripture leads us to conclude that God loves all people he created and that Christ died to provide salvation for all.** The provision side of the Atonement is part of the general will of God that must be preached to all. But beyond this, the Father loves the ‚Äúsheep‚Äù with a special love,<sup>117</sup> and in the divine will the Spirit applies the benefits of Christ‚Äôs death to the ‚Äúsheep,‚Äù or the elect. The application side of the Atonement is part of the special will of God shared with those who come to faith. This conclusion‚Äîthat Christ died to make atonement for all to the end that its benefits would be applied to the elect‚Äîcoheres with the perspective of **Sublapsarian Calvinism** <span style="color:#3EA055;">[Moderate Calvinism]</span>. **It differs from the Supralapsarian** <span style="color:darkred;">[Hyper-Calvinism]</span> and **Infralapsarian schemes** <span style="color:#FBB917;">[Scholastic Calvinism]</span>, which teach that Christ died to make provision only for the sins of the elect. And **it differs from the Arminian scheme** <span style="color:darkblue;">[Wesleyan]</span>  of decrees, which states that God willed the application of the Atonement to all, but that the divine purpose was frustrated by human resistance. A.H. Strong reflected the biblical perspective when he wrote, ‚ÄúNot the atonement therefore is limited, but the application through the work of the Holy Spirit.‚Äù<sup>118</sup> ... **The position outlined is not Arminianism (as some allege) but a viewpoint close to that of Calvin himself** ... &mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest (Ph.D., Manchester), The Cross and Salvation. p. 193.
