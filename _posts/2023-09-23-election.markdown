This article compares the minds of two intellectual titans, in an attempt to resolve once and for all, the conditionality or unconditionality of the doctrine of election. The verses I'd like to cover are as follows: Acts 13:48,2:23; Mt 22:14; Eph 1:4,11; Jn 15:16,18-19; Jn 6:44,65; Ro 8:29-30; 9:11-16; 1 Pe 1:2; Re 13:8; Lk 24:45; Jn 17:9, and Ro 10:9 + 1 Cor 12:3.

# Will only those elected to salvation believe or does God elect unto salvation based upon his foreknowledge of your faith?

There are many verses that prove that election is in the Bible, so it's not a matter of whether or not Christians believe in predestination, we all do, it a matter of how we understand how election is applied to believers that differ.
