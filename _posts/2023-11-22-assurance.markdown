Christ died for the sins of the world (1Jn 2:2), but not everyone goes to heaven. Only those who do the will of the father (Mt 7:21). They do the will of the father when they are saved by genuine saving faith (Eph 2:8-10), which is a trust and reliance that will “result” in the fruit of obedience to God (Jn 14:15; 1 Jn 2:4). This fruit Jesus spoke about will absolutely spring forth if you have a living faith (John 15:1-17; James 2:14-26) and represents the original definition of *sola fide* or faith alone. All who say otherwise deny the power of the Holy Spirit that indwells the believer upon the moment of faith (Rom. 8:9; 1Cor. 12:13; Eph 1:13-14). 

> No, I tell you; but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless you repent</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will</span> all likewise <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">perish</span>. &mdash; Luke 13:3 ESV

If you are unrepentant (Lk 13:3) and you pursue lifestyles of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Gal 5:19-21) **the only assurance you deserve is no assurance**. This is the wake up call that will save your life. You should be told to test to see if your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), to see if you really are trusting in Christ, because if you were, you'd be repentant, you'd carry your cross daily (Mt 10:38; Lk 9:23), and you'd have the assurance of being foreknown (Mt 22:14).

> &ldquo;For many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo; &mdash; Matthew 22:14 ESV

People with no understanding of scripture will attempt to tell you that fruit of being saved is works. This is of course the most rediculous lie you will ever be told. The fruit that springs forth from a true and lively faith is post-justification, and is the evidence that God has given us so that we might have assurance at all. Everything else is blind faith and **giving someone false assurance is one of the most evil and depraved things you can do.**
