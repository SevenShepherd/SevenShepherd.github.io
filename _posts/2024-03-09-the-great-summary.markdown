This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).

> First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, **I preached that they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds.** That is why some Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me. &mdash; The Apostle Paul (Acts 26:20-21).

Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ. Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
