Dear friends,

I write to you today about the future of this blog. We're migrating to a new website. Thank you for your patience, as blog posts here will slow down until we move to the new website.

We were going to move [here](https://bit.ly/42nkupJ), but we found that, while it was aesthetically pleasing, it was lacking in functionality. Thank you for your patience.

<!-- This migration transcends a mere relocation; it serves as a profound testament to our steadfast devotion in delivering content that exudes the highest caliber of Christian values and profound insight. -->

With deepest reverence,

&mdash; [SevenShepherd](https://bit.ly/42nkupJ)
