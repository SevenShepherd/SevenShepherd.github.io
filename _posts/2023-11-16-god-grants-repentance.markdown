<!-- God Has Granted The Repentance That Leads To Salvation -->

God has granted the repentance (Ac 11:18; 2 Tim. 2:25), and commanded us to repent (Ac 17:30; Mt 4:17; Lk 13:3). Repentance is a turning away from sin to God (Acts 26:20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), for the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31). It is His kindness (Ro 2:4) that leads us to this godly sorrow and contrition which produces a repentance that leads to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).

> No, I tell you; but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless you repent</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will</span> all likewise <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">perish</span>. &mdash; Luke 13:3 ESV

As [the most authoritative Greek lexicon](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) reveals, every instance of [metano√©≈ç](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [met√°noia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) means *‚Äúfeel remorse, repent, be converted‚Äù (in religio-ethical sense)*. We can thereby conclude that the meaning does not reflect it's etymology and is not just a change of mind, but instead it is a turning from sin to God in trust.

> Then he said, ‚ÄúI tell you the truth, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless you turn</span> from your sins and become like little children, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven</span>. &mdash; Matthew 18:3 NLT

We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only are you showing evidence that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but you're also showing evidence that your profession of faith is false (1Jn 2:3-6). Make sure your heart has not betrayed you (Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9), examine your faith to see if it is genuine (2Cor. 13:5 NLT).

<a name="grants" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">I. God Grants Repentance</a>

Many verses say repent & believe (Mk 1:15; Ac 20:21), while others say believe & repent (Acts 11:21; Rev. 3:3). Both faith (Jn 6:29; Phil. 1:29) and repentance (Acts 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25) are referred to as being granted. The reason we say saving faith &ldquo;results&rdquo; in obedience to God, and not &ldquo;includes,&rdquo; is because we know that we are saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-10). 

> When they heard this, they ceased their objections and praised God, saying, ‚ÄúSo then, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">God has <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">granted</span> the repentance that <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">leads to</span> life</span> even to the Gentiles.‚Äù &mdash; Acts 11:18 NET

> correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">God will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">grant</span> them repentance</span> and then knowledge of the truth &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:25 NET

<a name="grants" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.1 For The Forgiveness Of Sins</a>

The gospel can be summarized in different ways. Sometimes faith alone is named as the one thing necessary for salvation (see John 3:16; Acts 10:43; 13:38-39; 16:31; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 2:8‚Äì9), other times repentance alone is named (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10), and sometimes both are named (Acts 20:21). Genuine faith always involves repentance, and vice versa. But the preaching of repentance to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:46-47).

> ... ‚ÄòThere is **forgiveness of sins** for all who **repent**.‚Äô &mdash; Luke 24:47 NLT

> **Repent** therefore, and turn back, that **your sins may be blotted out**, &mdash; Acts 3:19 ESV

> Peter replied, ‚ÄúEach of you <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">must</span> **repent** of your sins and turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ **for the forgiveness of your sins**. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. &mdash; Acts 2:38 NLT

> God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give **repentance** to Israel and **forgiveness of sins**. &mdash; Acts 5:31 ESV

Because belief (Acts 10:43) & repentance (Ac 3:19) are repeatedly said to result in the forgiveness of sins, we say that saving faith results in repentance necessarily. Faith (trust & reliance) is intertwined with a resulting repentance (a turn from sin), because a genuine non-superficial faith carries with it a heart change. This could very will be God's work in us through the concept of regeneration (John 3:7).


<a name="commands" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">II. God Commands Us To Repent</a>

Failing to repent is the best way to show that you don't love God and that you've made a false profession.

> &ldquo;The times of **ignorance** God overlooked, but now <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">he commands</span> all people everywhere to **repent**,&rdquo; &mdash; Acts 17:30 ESV

<!-- > ‚ÄúIf you love me, <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will</span> keep my commandments.&rdquo; &mdash; John 14:15 ESV -->

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">‚ÄúIf you love me,</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will obey my commandments</span>. &mdash; John 14:15 NET

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me**. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.‚Äù &mdash; John 14:21 NET

> &ldquo;If someone claims, ‚ÄúI know God,‚Äù **but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">doesn‚Äôt obey God‚Äôs commandments</span>**, that person is a <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">liar</span> and is <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">not living in the truth</span>.&rdquo; &mdash; 1Jn 2:4 NLT (cf. Jn 14:15,21)

<a name="kindness" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">III. His Kindness Leads To Repentance</a>

> Or do you presume on the riches of **his kindness** and forbearance and patience, not knowing that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance</span>? &mdash; Romans 2:4 ESV
>> Don‚Äôt you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can‚Äôt you see that **his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin**? &mdash; Romans 2:4 NLT (Parallel)

<a name="kindness" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">IV. Godly Grief Produces Repentance</a>

This is a remorse, a **contrition** that leads to salvation. Wordly grief is an **attrition**, that leads to death.

> For <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">godly grief produces</span> a repentance that <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">leads to</span> salvation</span> without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. &mdash; 2 Corinthians 7:10 ESV
