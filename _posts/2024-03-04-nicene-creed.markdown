I believe in one God,<br>
the Father Almighty,<br>
Maker of heaven and earth,<br>
and of all things visible and invisible.<br>

And in one Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
the only begotten Son of God,<br>
begotten of the Father before all worlds;<br>
God of God,<br>
Light of Light,<br>
very God of very God;<br>
begotten, not made,<br>
being of one substance with the Father,<br>
by whom all things were made.<br>

Who, for us men and for our salvation,<br>
came down from heaven,<br>
and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man;<br>
and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered and was buried;<br>
and the third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures;<br>
and ascended into heaven,<br>
and sits at the right hand of the Father;<br>
and he shall come again, with glory,<br>
to judge the living and the dead;<br>
whose kingdom shall have no end.<br>

And I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
the Lord and giver of life;<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son;<br>
who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified;<br>
who spoke by the prophets.<br>

And I believe one holy catholic<sup style="font-weight:bold;">†</sup> and apostolic church.<br>
I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins;<br>
and I look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
and the life of the world to come.

Amen.

<!-- We believe in one God,
      the Father almighty,
      maker of heaven and earth,
      of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
      the only Son of God,
      begotten from the Father before all ages,
           God from God,
           Light from Light,
           true God from true God,
      begotten, not made;
      of the same essence as the Father.
      Through him all things were made.
      For us and for our salvation
           he came down from heaven;
           he became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the virgin Mary,
           and was made human.
           He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate;
           he suffered and was buried.
           The third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures.
           He ascended to heaven
           and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
           He will come again with glory
           to judge the living and the dead.
           His kingdom will never end.

And we believe in the Holy Spirit,
      the Lord, the giver of life.
      He proceeds from the Father and the Son,
      and with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified.
      He spoke through the prophets.
      We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.
      We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
      We look forward to the resurrection of the dead,
      and to life in the world to come. Amen. -->
