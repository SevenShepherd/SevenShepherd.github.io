When I was young I'd play against my family for about a month or so, my dad is the only one who ever beat me. My best friend (Daniel) at the time did as well, except the time I beat him (you owe me a game). After more than 20 years later I decided to play on chess.com recently (2023-11-19) and managed to get a **2650 elo rated game with the white pieces** after about a month of effort, although this isn't consistent for me since I've yet to take it seriously, though I am considering it.

<sup>\*The match was played against the 2300 rated AI bot named Francis. It likes to play the chigorin defense as black (Francis), against white (me), repeatedly and by doing so, allowed me time to learn the opening.</sup>

I learned to play chess from Bobby Fischer's book &ldquo;*Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess*&rdquo; when I was a preteen. Recreational mathematics, logic puzzles, and strategy board games like <a style="color:black;" href="https://youtu.be/cDJXsPS5FPM">chess</a>, have been shown to increase neuroplasticity. I find the whole game facinating, and while I've never taken it seriously as a sport, there are many inspirational figures like Bobby Fischer, & [Magnus](https://youtu.be/kw-629LEGRo?si=STZQBdWGT0rGQT53) that make the game intriguing.

If I had to attribute this massive increase in skill, without having played chess for 20 years, I would have to attribute it to the fact that I've kept my mind active with autodidactism and polymathy.
