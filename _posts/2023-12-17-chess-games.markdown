When I was young I'd play against my family for about a month or so, my dad is the only one who ever beat me. My best friend at the time did as well, except the time I beat him (you owe me a game). After more then 20 years later I decided to play on chess.com recently and managed to get a **2650 elo rated game as the white pieces** after about a month of effort, although this isn't consistent for me since I've yet to take it seriously, though I am considering it.

The match was played against the 2300 rated AI bot named Francis. It likes to play the chigorin defense as black (Francis), against white (me), repeatedly and by doing so, allowed me time to learn the opening.
