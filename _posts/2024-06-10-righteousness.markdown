The paradox that *&ldquo;none is righteous, no, not one&rdquo;* (Ro 3:10), and *&ldquo;the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as Jesus is righteous&rdquo;* (1Jn 3:7), is easily reconciled when you understand the different contexts of merit and fruit-bearing.

> Little children, let no one deceive you: The one who practices righteousness<span style="color:#a8a8a8;">[a]</span> is righteous, just as Jesus<span style="color:#a8a8a8;">[b]</span> is righteous. 1 John 3:7

 <!-- *, ‚Ä†, ‚Ä°, ¬ß, ‚Äñ, ¬∂. -->

On the one hand **we cannot** merit (earn) our salvation by works. Justification is by faith apart from works of the law (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28). We are totally depraved, which means, that man can never be good enough to merit his own salvation, our works appear as dirty rags (Isaiah 64:6 NLT) in this context. It also entails the inability to even desire to do good without the regeneration of the Holy Spirit.

> We believe that all are sinners (Romans 3:23) and unable by human performance to earn, deserve, or merit salvation (Titus 3:5). We believe that the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), and that apart from God's grace, no one can be saved (Ephesians 2:8-9). We believe that none are righteous, **or capable of doing good** (Romans 3:10-12), and that **apart from the conviction and regeneration of the Holy Spirit, none can be saved** (John 1:12-13; 16:8-11; 1 Peter 1:23-25). **Mankind is clearly fallen and lost in sin.**<sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚Ä†</sup>

&ldquo;The phrase total depravity is commonly used to make explicit the implications of original sin. It signifies a corruption of our moral and spiritual nature that is total not in degree (for no-one is as bad as he or she might be) but in extent. It declares that no part of us is untouched by sin, and therefore no action of ours is as good as it should be, and consequently nothing in us or about us ever appears meritorious in God‚Äôs eyes. We cannot earn God‚Äôs favour, no matter what we do; unless grace saves us, we are lost.&rdquo;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">¬ß</sup>

>>a. 1 John 3:7 sn The one who practices righteousness. The participle (·ΩÅ œÄŒøŒπ·ø∂ŒΩ, ho poi≈çn) + noun constructions in 3:7 and in 3:8a, the first positive and the second negative, serve to emphasize **the contrast between the true Christians (‚Äúthe one who practices righteousness‚Äù) and the opponents (‚Äúthe one who practices sin,‚Äù 3:8a)**.
>>
>>b. 1 John 3:7 tn Grk ‚Äúthat one.‚Äù Context indicates a reference to Jesus here. As with the previous uses of ·ºêŒ∫Œµ·øñŒΩŒøœÇ (ekeinos) by the author of 1 John (2:6; 3:3, 5), this one refers to Jesus, as the reference to ‚Äúthe Son of God‚Äù in the following verse (3:8) makes clear.

In the second context we find that Christians can live righteously, and are expected to [*&ldquo;practice&rdquo;*](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/) righteousness or they are not true born again believers (1Jn 3:10 ESV). In these examples they are not speaking of merit, they're speaking of [fruit-bearing](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/) (John 15:1-17).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. &mdash; Matthew 5:16 KJV

The difference is, that every Christian understands that the righteousness they [*&ldquo;practice&rdquo;*](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/) is not meritorious, it is for God's glory and a fruit of genuine saving faith. The Holy Spirit produces these fruits and righteousness in our lives and sanctifies us (Gal 5:22-23 NLT).

> Some people may contradict our teaching, but **these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. These teachings promote a godly life.** 4 Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding... &mdash; 1 Timothy 6:3-4 NLT

Justification is by [faith alone](/assets/images/solas.jpg) (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.

3. Verses for obedience &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; justification (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
4. Verses for Godly dispositions of Love (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
5. Verses for Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; Gal 5:22-23).
6. Verses for good works &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
7. The Holy Spirit produces the fruit, not human decision (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7). -->

If you are having a hard time locating sources of truth in Christianity, remember, [you will know them by their fruits](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/). Do not listen to a person who claims to be Christian and [pursues a lifestyle of sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/), they give no evidence of being born again, do not accept their doctrine, do not walk their path. 

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚Ä°</sup> &mdash; <span style="color:#00cc44;">Historic Protestant Position</span>

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone has sin (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10 ESV), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10 ESV). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).
