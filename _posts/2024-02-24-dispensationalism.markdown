<!-- Zero Reasons Why You Should Believe Dispensationalism -->

<!-- Things You Probably Didn't Know About Dispensationalism (Revised) -->

Growing up, dispensationalism was probably one of my favorite eschatological systems. It brought me such hope and joy to look forward to a pre-tribulational rapture, but over the years, and the more I study it, the more pronounced it's flaws seem to be (Ecc 1:18). I'm presenting this small critique because I'm about to study eschatology from 6 different systems simultaneously. If I absolutely had to change systems, I'd probably look into Historic Premillennialism, a system held by [Dr. Walter Martin (Ph.D., California Coast University)](https://youtu.be/uO0TAHKzPFw?si=qbF7x_gk18zTGVht), and Dr. D.A. Carson (Ph.D., University of Cambridge).

The first 1:20 seconds of this video will floor you if you understand the gravity of what is being said.

> so what I elected to do this evening is something very simple how many have your Bibles good what I'd like to do is to tell you first off that the position I am going to set forth tonight is not new as number one secondly the position I will set forth tonight was believed by the Christian Church for 19 centuries the Church Fathers the Reformers every great theologian in the entire history of the church up until the last 140 years believed that we would see the Anti Christ that we would be persecuted by him and that we would be delivered from him by the second coming of Jesus Christ you will find this in Catholic theology you will find that in Orthodox theology you will find it in all of the reformers and **you will not find the idea that we are going to escape the Antichrist until approximately a hundred and forty years ago when a 15 year old girl had a revelation and that revelation was picked up by J. N. Darby the founder of the Plymouth Brethren and developed into a form of theology known as dispensational theology** the church for 19 centuries. &mdash; [Dr. Walter Martin (Ph.D., California Coast University)](https://youtu.be/uO0TAHKzPFw?si=qbF7x_gk18zTGVht).

<a name="antinomianism" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Can Introduce Antinomianism</a>

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: **Chuck Smith was a dispensationalist but he was definitely [not a dispensational antinomian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/assurance/).** If you want to stick to dispensationalism, Smith or Rhodes will teach it without antinomianism.

It's true that justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), thats common to all protestants. It's true that we are under grace and [no longer under the law](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#packer-on-legalism). The mistake this disp. sect is making is [distorting scripture and the doctrine of faith alone](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/).

> **Dispensational antinomianism** holds that keeping the moral law is at no
stage necessary for Christians, since we live under a dispensation of grace,
not of law. Romans 3:31 and 1 Corinthians 6:9‚Äì11 clearly show, however,
that law-keeping is a continuing obligation for Christians. ‚ÄòI am not free
from God‚Äôs law but am under Christ‚Äôs law,‚Äô says Paul (1 Cor. 9:21).

&mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (PhD, University of Oxford), Concise Theology. 66. Antinomianism: We are not set free to sin. On [faith](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo), on [repentance](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8).

Packer is a protestant that teaches [faith alone](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-instrument/), [liberty](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#packer-on-liberty) from the law, and [against the heresy of legalism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#packer-on-legalism). What he's saying is what Paul is saying in Romans 3:31. It's time for those lost in dispensational antinomianism to return to scripture. The Apostle Paul, through the inspiration of God, has provided the correction.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> What shall we say then? **Are we to remain in sin** so that grace may increase? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> **Absolutely not!** How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> What then? **Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!** &mdash; Romans 6:1-2,15 NET

These verses prove the following three things:
1. We're not under the law (Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. We're under grace (Eph 2:8-10)
3. We still don't make a "practice" of sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31).

<a name="chafer" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">üÜñ Chafer Corrupted The Gospel Message Surrounding Repentance Then Contributed To Dispensationalism</a>

100% proof will be provided, but for now, refer to actual teachers like [Chuck Smith](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) and Lexicons like [BDAG](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/#BDAG) to see that &ldquo;*Change of mind*&rdquo; was a meaning that was never applied to NT instances of repentance. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ.

I feel just as betrayed as Heiser, as I was also raised in dispensational theology, and held to it for half my life.

> [@9:07](https://youtu.be/_T4AhNUHxZA?si=U38kJ0fV8aX_Ss-d&t=547) ... I'm gonna say this; with a few of them, you really can say things like, they just gotta make stuff up to make it work. **I was raised in classic dispensational thought, that was my first Christian context.** And classic dispensationalism is Charles Ryrie and CI Scofield, those guys. And Ryrie got to the point where he had to... you have to understand; classic dispensationalism, I've been trying to teach you that prophecy is already but not yet. You got both things working. Classic dispensationalism says "there is no already. It's all not yet." And so, when **Ryrie would get cornered on like Kingdom language** and stuff like this, he literally in one of his books, he wanted so badly for the New Covenant to not be fulfilled in the New Testament. That **he said "well then we need to expect a New-New Covenant." Like he just made up a New-New Covenant, like right there in a book.** Okay, can I invent something and have a system too? Is that the new ground rule now? Like you just make one up? I'm going to call my covenant, the Mike Covenant. **You'll see stuff like this happen.** That when you look back on it, it makes you laugh, but like he was serious, he was serious about this. And he was a major figure in biblical scholarship in that tradition.

> The Rapture is a belief that Jesus Christ will return initially for the church. He will come‚Äîbut not quite to earth. Here‚Äôs how: Jesus will come, and then the church will be taken up to meet him. This view of the rapture is prominent in a system of theology called premillennial dispensationalism. 
>
But here‚Äôs the problem: you end up with two second comings. 
>
You get Jesus coming the first time for the church to rapture them away. 
>
Then after a period of tribulation he comes again for the second time. This is the second part of the second coming, second coming 2.B where he comes with the church largely in judgment to rescue those who also became believers during a great period of great tribulation.
>
However, this isn‚Äôt what the Bible says about the rapture. The New Testament doesn‚Äôt split up the second coming of Jesus along those lines. 
>
Instead, the second coming of Jesus is more singular, more unitary, more comprehensive, more definitive. There is a period of tribulation or trial that comes upon the world. There's apostasy, and there's persecution, the sort of thing spoken about in 1 Thessalonians. Then at the end of that, after a period of tribulation, Christ returns. 
>
It's not that the church is raptured to go meet him, but rather he returns definitively. 
>
As Paul says, he then hands over the kingdom to the Father. This is the moment where Jesus will be by might what he is by right, Lord of all.

> 16 And since Abraham and the other patriarchs were holy, their descendants will also be holy‚Äîjust as the entire batch of dough is holy because the portion given as an offering is holy. For if the roots of **the tree** are holy, the **branches** will be, too.
>
17 But some of these **branches** from Abraham‚Äôs tree‚Äîsome of the people of Israel‚Äîhave been broken off. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">And you Gentiles, who were **branches** from a wild olive tree, have been grafted in.</span> So now you also receive the blessing God has promised Abraham and his children, sharing in the rich nourishment from the root of God‚Äôs special olive tree. 18 But you must not brag about being grafted in to replace the **branches** that were broken off. You are just a branch, not the root.
>
19 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù you may say, ‚Äúthose **branches** were broken off to make room for me.‚Äù 20 Yes, but remember‚Äîthose **branches** were broken off because they didn‚Äôt believe in Christ, and you are there because you do believe. So don‚Äôt think highly of yourself, but fear what could happen. 21 For if God did not spare the original **branches**, he won‚Äôt spare you either.
>
22 Notice how God is both kind and severe. He is severe toward those who disobeyed, but kind to you if you continue to trust in his kindness. But if you stop trusting, you also will be cut off. 23 And if the people of Israel turn from their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, for God has the power to graft them back into the tree. 24 You, by nature, were a branch cut from a wild olive tree. So if God was willing to do something contrary to nature by grafting you into his cultivated tree, he will be far more eager to graft the original **branches** back into the tree where they belong.
>
&mdash; Romans 11:16-24 NLT

Just some food for thought.

> And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children of Abraham. You are his heirs, and God‚Äôs promise to Abraham belongs to you. &mdash; Galatians 3:29 NLT

<a name="death" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em">‚ò†Ô∏è It Is Appointed Unto Men Once To Die</a>

Many people hope on a pre-tribulational rapture because, to them, it functions as a &lsquo;get out of jail free card&rsquo; when it comes to dying. Of course, anyone would jump at the chance to get out of dying, but that doesn't mean it's scriptural. Is this simply hope, or is it a spirit of fear that causes people to gravitate toward doctrines they cannot prove? For me, in the past it was hope and trust in teachers who I thought knew better, but I suspect many people overlook what scripture says out of fear.

> And just as **each person is destined to die once** and after that comes judgment, &mdash; Hebrews 9:27 NLT

> for God gave us a spirit **not of fear** but of power and love and self-control. &mdash; 2 Timothy 1:7

You might be quick to provide me with verses I've known since I was a child such as, &ldquo;*We shall not all sleep*&rdquo;, but this is likely talking about the second coming, and is not only just as applicable to it, but more logical to say, that upon Christ's return we're transformed post-tribulationally.

> Behold! I tell you a mystery. **We shall not all sleep**, but we shall all be changed,
>> But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. **We will not all die**, but we will all be transformed! &mdash; 1 Corinthians 15:51 ESV, NLT (Parallel)
