<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;color:red;">Israel Wasn't Even In Existence When the Most High Divided The Nations!</span>

The fact that Israel didn't even exist at this point in the Bible proves that the **much older** Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) & Septuagint (LXX) are more reliable than the Masoretic Text (MT). Deut. 32:8 is a reference to Gen. 11:1-9, a time before Israel.

> When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">children of Israel</span>. &mdash; Deuteronomy 32:8 King James Version (KJV)

The only versions of the Bible that survived my previous [litmus tests](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-best-bible/), that also have the correct "<span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">sons of God</span>" or "<span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">heavenly assembly / court</span>" translation are the: **ESV, NET, NOAB (NRSV), and NLT**.

> c. Deuteronomy 32:8 tc Heb “the sons of Israel.” The idea, perhaps, is that Israel was central to Yahweh’s purposes and all other nations were arranged and distributed according to how they related to Israel. See S. R. Driver, Deuteronomy (ICC), 355-56. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">For the MT יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּנֵי (bene yisraʾel, “sons of Israel”)</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">a Qumran fragment has “sons of God,” while the LXX reads ἀγγέλων θεοῦ (angelōn theou, “angels of God”), presupposing בְּנֵי אֵל (bene ʾel) or בְּנֵי אֵלִים (bene ʾelim). “Sons of God” is undoubtedly the original reading;</span> the MT and LXX have each interpreted it differently. MT assumes that the expression “sons of God” refers to Israel (cf. Hos. 1:10), while LXX has assumed that the phrase refers to the angelic heavenly assembly (Pss 29:1; 89:6; cf. as well Ps 82). The phrase is also attested in Ugaritic, where it refers to the high god El’s divine assembly. According to the latter view, which is reflected in the translation, the Lord delegated jurisdiction over the nations to his angelic host (cf. Dan. 10:13-21), while reserving for himself Israel, over whom he rules directly. For a defense of the view taken here, see M. S. Heiser, “Deuteronomy 32:8 and the Sons of God,” BSac 158 (2001): 52-74.

> **8**: Most High, or Elyon (text note b), is a title of El, the senior god who sat at the head of the divine council in the Ugaritic literature of ancient Canaan. The Bible applies El’s title to Israel’s God (Gen 14.18–22; Num 24.16; Pss 46.4; 47.2; esp. 78.35, where it is parallel to Rock). Gods, the lesser gods who make up the divine council (Pss 82.1; 89.6–7), to each of whom Elyon here assigns a foreign nation. **9**: The Lord’s own portion, NRSV has added own in order to identify Yahweh with Elyon and avoid the impression that Yahweh is merely a member of the pantheon; see also 4.19n.

<!-- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">Textual Purity Of The OT Is Greater Than The NT's 99.8%</span>

Scholars agree that **no cardinal doctrine is affected** by any viable variant. To be sure, minor doctrinal differences and matters of orthopraxy ("right action") are affected by variants, but regardless of what text one uses, **Jesus is affirmed as God in the flesh, as rising from the dead bodily, as ascending to heaven and as coming again some day.** 

> "**99.8% of textual variants affect nothing**, most are spelling differences. there's different ways to spell John, there's different ways to spell Mary, they're not going to affect anything, but **the one-fifth of 1% that do affect things are the ones that scholars talk about**. The bottom line is it does not matter in some respects which New Testament you use because **no essential doctrine is jeopardized** by any of these textual variants" &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor, Ph.D.](https://youtu.be/NikVdhp0YFs)

Now imagine how much less you have to worry about the OT. -->
