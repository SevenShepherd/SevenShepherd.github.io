<span style="font-size:2.1em">Anger Rests In The Bosom Of Fools</span>

A clear sign of a foolish and misguided person, is one who is angry and prone to infantile temper tantrums. What could be more embarrassing than a grown man who cannot control his emotions?

> Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the heart of fools. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 7:9 ESV

One with great understanding is slow to anger, and one who shows great foolishness is quick tempered.

> Someone with great understanding is slow to anger, but the one who has a quick temper exalts folly. &mdash; Proverbs 14:29 NET

Put away this ignorant behavior, mature, progressing in sanctification. You cannot be an infant the rest of your life can you?

> You must put away all bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling, and slanderous talkâ€”indeed all malice. &mdash; Ephesians 4:31 NET

> But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. &mdash; Colossians 3:8 ESV

Instead, let us be quick to listen and investigate information presented to us, instead of burying our heads in the sand and flying off the hook every time someone provides a different perspective or provides constructive criticism (Proverbs 9:8-9).

> Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. For human anger does not accomplish Godâ€™s righteousness. &mdash; James 1:19-20

If you happen upon such a person, avoid them if you can. They will eventually destroy themselves and drag you down along with them. Your best defense is always to respond with a gentle answer.

> Donâ€™t befriend angry people or associate with hot-tempered people, &mdash; Proverbs 22:24

> A gentle response turns away anger, but a harsh word stirs up wrath. &mdash; Proverbs 15:1 NET

Do you not know that people who behave in this manner have deceived themselves (James 1:22) and will not inherit the Kingdom of God? It does not achieve the righteousness of God.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, **hostility**, **quarreling**, jealousy, **outbursts of anger**, selfish ambition, **dissension**, **division**, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that **anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God**. &mdash; Galatians 5:19-21

> For human anger does not accomplish Godâ€™s righteousness. &mdash; James 1:20 NET
