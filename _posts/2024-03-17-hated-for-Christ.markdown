<!-- And The Almost Comical Reaction Of False Teachers To Christ's Teachings On Repentance And Fruit-Bearing -->

<!-- Labeling those who correct you in love as hateful is a tactic of Satan himself. Such people lack the spirit of God. Beware of false teachers who divide families and stray from scripture. -->

<!-- One of the most hateful things, done in the spirit of Satan himself, is to label those who correct you in love, as hateful themselves. People who do this are devoid of the spirit of God.  -->

<!-- “” ― --> 

It has become a reoccurring theme to find myself the target of false teachers and false converts.

- Years ago, false witness caused unprovoked attacks and several years of malicious slander against me, targeting my God-given abilities and progress. Envy turned to hatred, despite my kindness and refusal to retaliate.
- The second instance is happening recently for defending the scriptures, and defending the founder of a movement who was loyal to what the Bible teaches. A possible heretical sect has taken over in recent years. An attempt to correct their false teachings has caused them to showcase great pride, anger, and false witness against me yet again. 

It is my experience with modern movements, that they are filled with anger, hatred, and judgement for those who are correcting them in love. Many do not bear [the fruits that Christ told us to look for](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/) in the lives of the those with genuine saving faith. 

> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">for correction</span>, and for training in righteousness, &mdash; 2 Timothy 3:16 ESV

The Bible shows that not only are they unwise for becoming frustrated at a very soft admonition...

<!-- > <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you</span>; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">reprove a wise man, and he will love you</span>. &mdash; Proverbs 9:8 ESV -->

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">So don’t bother correcting mockers; they will only hate you.</span> But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">correct the wise, and they will love you.</span> &mdash; Proverbs 9:8 NLT

... but that there is great evidence that they are false professors. Love was taught from the beginning (1 Jn 3:11), I have talked for hours not only to people of my own faith within protestantism, but I've also spoken in love to those lost in the cults in my family, sometimes for 5 hours straight without any negative experience, and always ending in kindness.

> If someone says, “I love God,” but hates a fellow believer, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">that person is a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">liar</span></span>; for if we don’t love people we can see, how can we love God, whom we cannot see? &mdash; 1 John 4:20 NLT

> So now <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">we can tell</span> who are children of God and who are <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">children of the devil</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Anyone</span> who does not live righteously [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%203%3A10&version=MOUNCE" style="font-style:italic;color:#A8A8A8;">dikaiosynē</a>] and does not love [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%203%3A10&version=MOUNCE" style="font-style:italic;color:#A8A8A8;">agapaō</a>] other believers <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">does not belong to God</span>. &mdash; 1 John 3:10 NLT


The reason those who would mislabel me and bear false witness against me do such things is because they do not have the spirit of God living inside of them. Otherwise they would have looked at the information provided and examined themselves first before assaulting others. The very fact that they would assault the information that their own founder provided is telling evidence that they have fallen very far from the tree.

> These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because they do not have God’s Spirit in them. &mdash; Jude 1:19 NLT

For the past decade or so, all I have shown to others is Love, and correction when needed. Experiencing the hatred by these false movements first hand ...

> But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. &mdash; Matthew 5:22 ESV

.. being projected upon, mislabeled, misrepresented, and slandered; I knew, in those moments, that Satan had recognized God's work through me as disruptive to his plans and had targeted me individually.

> For you are the children of your father the devil, and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from the beginning. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">He has always hated the truth, because there is no truth in him.</span> When he lies, it is consistent with his character; for he is a liar and the father of lies. &mdash; John 8:44 NLT

> “... When God became a man Himself, the experience proved to be nothing short of pure agony. In man’s time-honored fashion, they would unleash the whole arsenal of weapons against Him: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">misrepresentation, slander, and accusation of treason</span>. The stage was set for a situation without parallel in the history of the earth. God would visit creatures and they would nail Him to the cross!” &mdash; Werner von Braun, the father of space science

> There are six things which Yahweh hates, Even seven **which are an abomination to Him**: Haughty eyes, **a lying tongue**, And hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked thoughts, Feet that hasten to run to evil, **A false witness who breathes out lies, <span style="color:FireBrick;">And one who spreads strife among brothers</span>.** &mdash; Proverbs 6:16-19

The Bible has given us instruction on which way to turn, and we are to turn to the old ways and ancient paths for the truth. Return to the old paths as scripture instructs.

> Thus says the Lord:<br>
“Stand by the roads, and look,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and ask for the ancient paths,<br>
where the good way is; and walk in it,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and find rest for your souls.<br>
But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’ 
>
&mdash; Jeremiah 6:16 ESV

Now that **I am being persecuted**, I will no longer hold back in talking about these incredibly destructive movements. I will delineate their shortcomings responsibly.

> It isn’t my responsibility to judge outsiders, but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning</span>. God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, “You must remove the evil person from among you.” &mdash; 1 Corinthians 5:12-13 NLT

Labeling those who correct you in love as hateful is a tactic of Satan himself. Such people lack the spirit of God. Beware of false teachers who stray from scripture and divide families.

> The words of the wise are like cattle prods—painful but helpful. Their collected sayings are like a nail-studded stick with which a shepherd drives the sheep. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 12:11 NLT

> If you repay good with evil, evil will never leave your house. &mdash; Proverbs 17:13

Remember that it is not me that they hate, it's Christ himself. No one is hated more than he who speaks the truth.

> The world can’t hate you, but it does hate me <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">because I accuse it of doing evil</span>. &mdash; **Jesus** in John 7:7 NLT

<!-- > “If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first. The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it, but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world, so it hates you. &mdash; John 15:18-19 NLT -->

Repent.
