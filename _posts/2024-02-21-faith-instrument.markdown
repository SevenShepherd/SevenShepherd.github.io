> **61\. JUSTIFICATION**<br>
SALVATION IS BY GRACE THROUGH FAITH
>
>>Clearly no-one is justified before God by the law, because, ‘The righteous will live by faith.’
Galatians 3:11
>
The doctrine of justification, the storm-centre of the Reformation, was a
major concern of the apostle Paul. For him it was the heart of the gospel
(Rom. 1:17; 3:21 – 5:21; Gal. 2:15 – 5:1) shaping both his message (Acts
13:38–39) and his devotion and spiritual life (2 Cor. 5:13–21; Phil. 3:4–14).
Though other New Testament writers affirm the same doctrine in substance,
the terms in which Protestants have affirmed and defended it for almost five
centuries are drawn primarily from Paul.
>
Justification is a judicial act of God pardoning sinners (wicked and
ungodly persons, Rom. 4:5; 3:9–24), accepting them as just, and so putting
permanently right their previously estranged relationship with himself. This
justifying sentence is God’s gift of righteousness (Rom. 5:15–17), his
bestowal of a status of acceptance for Jesus’ sake (2 Cor. 5:21).
>
God’s justifying judgment seems strange, for pronouncing sinners
righteous may appear to be precisely the unjust action on the judge’s part
that God’s own law forbade (Deut. 25:1; Prov. 17:15). Yet it is in fact a just
judgment, for its basis is the righteousness of Jesus Christ who as ‘the last
Adam’ (1 Cor. 15:45), our representative head acting on our behalf, obeyed
the law that bound us and endured the retribution for lawlessness that was
our due and so (to use a medieval technical term) ‘merited’ our justification.
So we are justified justly, on the basis of justice done (Rom. 3:25–26) and
Christ’s righteousness reckoned to our account (Rom. 5:18–19).
>
God’s justifying decision is the judgment of the Last Day, declaring
where we shall spend eternity, brought forward into the present and
pronounced here and now. It is the last judgment that will ever be passed on
our destiny; God will never go back on it, however much Satan may appeal
against God’s verdict (Zech. 3:1; Rev. 12:10; Rom. 8:33–34). To be
justified is to be eternally secure (Rom. 5:1–5; 8:30).
>
The necessary means, or instrumental cause, of justification is personal
faith in Jesus Christ as crucified Saviour and risen Lord (Rom. 4:23–25;
10:8–13). This is because the meritorious ground of our justification is
entirely in Christ. As we give ourselves in faith to Jesus, Jesus gives us his
gift of righteousness, so that in the very act of ‘closing with Christ’, as older
Reformed teachers put it, we receive divine pardon and acceptance which
we could not otherwise have (Gal. 2:15–16; 3:24).
>
Official Roman Catholic theology includes sanctification in the
definition of justification, which it sees as a process rather than a single
decisive event, and affirms that while faith contributes to our acceptance
with God, our works of satisfaction and merit contribute too. Rome sees
baptism, viewed as a channel of sanctifying grace, as the primary
instrumental cause of justification, and the sacrament of penance, whereby
congruous merit is achieved through works of satisfaction, as the
supplementary restorative cause whenever the grace of God’s initial
acceptance is lost through mortal sin. Congruous, as distinct from condign,
merit means merit that it is fitting, though not absolutely necessary, for God
to reward by a fresh flow of sanctifying grace. On the Roman Catholic
view, therefore, believers save themselves with the help of the grace that
flows from Christ through the church’s sacramental system, and in this life
no sense of confidence in God’s grace can ordinarily be had. Such teaching
is a far cry from that of Paul.

&mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (PhD, University of Oxford), Concise Theology. 61. Justification: Salvation Is By Grace Through Faith. On [faith](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo), on [repentance](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8). Verses (cf. Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28).

<!-- Salvation is by grace alone and justification in the sight of God is by faith alone. 

> For we hold that one is justified by **faith apart from works** of the law. &mdash; Romans 3:28 ESV (cf. Eph 2:8-10)

Faith is the instrument by which we lay hold of God's grace, faith means to "trust in" God, it is a reliance on him for salvation apart from any works we can do. We cannot merit our salvation.

> Remain in me, and I will remain in you. **Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself**, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me. &mdash; John 15:4

Once a person is saved and justified by this trust/faith, they will receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit the moment they believe (Eph 1:13-14). We learn in both Galatians 5:22-23 and John 15:1-17 that God works these fruits of the faith in us, like obedience (1Jn 2:4), repentance (Lk 13:3) and good works (James 2:14-26) that characterize a Holy Spirit filled individual.

> “Yes, I am the vine; you are the branches. **Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit.** For apart from me you can do nothing. &mdash; John 15:5

We're not saved by these fruits, salvation simply produces them post-justification "after we're already saved." That is why I say, obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience.

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me.** And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.” &mdash; John 14:21 (cf. Jn 14:15)

Being a basic or historic protestant makes us a part of the group responsible for the original reformation doctrine of faith alone or sole fide. A faith that results in dispositions of love and Godly character.

> Some people may contradict our teaching, but **these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. These teachings promote a godly life.** 4 Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding... &mdash; 1 Timothy 6:3-4 NLT

By grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to scripture alone, for the glory of God alone. These are known as the [Five Solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg).

> “No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.” — Jesus in Luke 13:3 ESV
>> “Not at all! And you will perish, too, unless you repent of your sins and turn to God.” — Jesus in Luke 13:3 NLT (Parallel)

This is why we can confidently preach Christ's message of repentance (turning away from sin to God in Mt 4:17; Acts 26:20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5; 3:3) and if you don't repent that you will die (Lk 13:3); and also why we can confidently teach that Christians do not "practice sin" (Ro 6:1-2,15; 1Jn 3:6-10), which means that we do not pursue lifestyles of indulgent sin, because for supernatural reasons we're incapable (1Jn 5:18).

> Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, &mdash; 1 John 2:4 ESV (cf. Acts 17:30)

So when Christ says that you can know a true Christian by their fruits he really means it, because if your faith was genuine it would bear these outcomes. **Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically.** The fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23). If the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10).

> “If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, you are not worthy of being mine.” — Jesus in Matthew 10:38 NLT

**So we have learned it is not the fruit that saves, its the salvation the grows the fruit.** If you are saved you will bear fruit (Jn 15:5). This opens up discussions of God's work of regeneration (Jn 3:7), the Holy Spirit's sanctification, and God granted repentance (Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25). This is not your doing it's Gods, so if you're not saved, you won't see these outcomes.

> “The world can’t hate you, but it does hate me because I accuse it of doing evil.” — Jesus"
