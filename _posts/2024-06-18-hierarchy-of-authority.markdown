<a name="Hierarchy-of-Authority" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üßÆ I. Hierarchy of Authority</a>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">1Ô∏è‚É£ God (1Jn 2:27)</span>
- Christ is the Chief or Great Shepherd (1Pe 5:4; Heb 13:20).
- The Holy Spirit interprets scripture in those he indwells (1Jn 2:27; Jn 14:26;16:13; 2Pe 1:20-21; 1 Cor 2:12-14)

<!-- 
- *&ldquo;... **the NT has about 5,600 extant copies in Greek alone**, ... **10,000 in latin**, **several thousand copies** ... **several hundred thousand** patristic **quotations** ...&rdquo;* &mdash; Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Ph.D., Dallas Theological Seminary) paraphrased.
- *&ldquo; If you could stack up all handwritten manuscripts of the New Testament‚ÄîGreek, Syriac, Latin, Coptic, all languages‚Äîhow tall would the stack be? ... I have said in many lectures that it would be the **equivalent of c. 4 & 1/2 Empire State Buildings stacked on top of each other**.&rdquo;* &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Ph.D., Dallas Theological Seminary)](https://danielbwallace.com/tag/number-of-new-testament-manuscripts/) 
-->

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">2Ô∏è‚É£ The Holy Scriptures</span>
- **The Biblical Hebrew & Koine Greek Scriptures Themselves**
   1. [**The Critical Text**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/) is the Greek text that scholars have compiled as closest to the original autograph (manuscripts). This is **highly recommended**. (ESV, NET, NLT, LEB, LSB, NASB).
   2. The Majority Text (WEB)
   3. [The Textus Receptus](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/) was composed by a Catholic Priest named Erasmus. (KJV, NKJV).
      - The TR was not historically received by all or even by Erasmus himself as there are 27 different and conflicting Textus Receptus‚Äô. 
      - Erasmus felt that the doctrine of *Faith Alone* was not supported in the bible in the simplistic way Luther proposed.
      - Erasmus only used around 3 manuscripts to produce the severely anemic Textus Receptus. There are approximately 5000 mss of the Byzantine MT. So it‚Äôs not actually Majority text by methodology.
      - Erasmus lacked the last leaf of Revelation, back translated from a defective copy of the Latin Vulgate, and created 20 errors that don‚Äôt exist in any Greek mss, botching the last 6 verses of revelation, the very place the bible warns not to get wrong! **Not Recommended**

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">3Ô∏è‚É£ The World's Most Authoritative Lexicons & Biblical Language Scholars</span>
- These are composed by the brightest **biblical language scholars** on earth, they know philology, linguistics, textual criticism, exegesis, hermeneutics, and specialize in Koine Greek as well as ancient near eastern & semitic languages like Akkadian, Ugaritic, Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic. 
- **BDAG** - A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd ed.
- **HALOT** - The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Theologians **ARE NOT** Biblical Language Scholars. Know the difference.


<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">4Ô∏è‚É£ English Bible Translations </span>
- Without biblical language scholars and the lexicons mentioned above, **we would not have English Bibles**, lexicons, or dictionaries. This is why they take precedence. Keep in mind, I did put the actual scriptures above them.
   1. Reverse Interlinear Bibles
      - The English-Greek Reverse Interlinear New Testament: English Standard Version (ESV)
   2. Optimal Equivalent Bibles With Full Translators‚Äô notes
      - The [**NET Bible: Full Notes Edition**]() is a completely new, non-sectarian and "inter-denominational," translation of the Bible with 60,932 translators‚Äô notes, completed by more than <a href="https://netbible.com/preface/">25+ of the world‚Äôs foremost biblical scholars</a> from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Columbia, Dallas, etc. This is the largest set of translators‚Äô notes ever created. Textual Basis: Masoretic Text BHS [B19<sup>A</sup>(L)], DSS; NA28, UBS4. Many distinguished scholars.
   3. Formal Equivalent Bibles With Studies
      - The [**ESV Study Bible**]() has over 200+ biblical scholars ([100+](https://www.esv.org/translation/) ESV; 95 Study); 9 countries, 20 denominations, 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities, including Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, London, Japan, California, MIT, Duke, Westminister, Dallas, etc. 20,000 study notes, 80,000 cross-references, 200+ charts, 50+ articles, 240 full-color maps and illustrations. Textual Basis: Masoretic Text BHS '83, DSS, LXX, SP, S, Vg; UBS5, NA28. Many distinguished scholars.
   4. Dynamic Equivalent Meaning Based Bibles
      - The [**NLT Filament Study Bible**]() has [over 90+ Scholars](https://www.tyndale.com/nlt/meet-the-scholars) in translation from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Columbia, Westminster, Dallas, etc. The study brings even more to the table. In addition to the NLT being the most readable Bible version on earth according to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [analysis](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf), many distinguished scholars.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">5Ô∏è‚É£ Evangelists, Shepherds, Pastors, Overseers, & Elders (The Educators of God's Word)</span>

Without biblical language scholars we wouldn't have English Bibles, lexicons, or dictionaries, and without these tools we would not have Evangelists who spread the Gospel or Shepherds to tend and feed the flock. Every position listed here is vital, like the organs in your body, to the functioning of the body of Christ. Sound teachings on [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) and faith, prove that these are the good Bereans the Bible asks us to be.

<!-- - Evangelists are those who have a specific calling to proclaim the gospel, often focusing on spreading the message of Christ to those who have not heard it before or to new regions. They might be involved in missionary work or outreach activities. (cf. Eph 4:11; 2 Tim 4:5; Mt 28:19-20; Mk 16:15; Romans 10:14-15.)
- Evangelists, such as the Apostle Paul, were typically the most outspoken and confrontational. Their primary role was to spread the gospel, often in new and hostile environments. This required a bold and assertive approach to overcome opposition and establish new Christian communities. -->

1. **Evangelists (euangelistas)**: I cannot conceive of a role more essential and foundational than the evangelist's. The dissemination of the gospel message (Romans 10:14-15; Mt 28:19-20; Mk 16:15) stands paramount, with the Apostles themselves embodying this mission (cf. Eph 4:11; 2 Tim 4:5). This priority underscores the very heart of their calling and the enduring legacy of their evangelical endeavors.
   - Evangelists, exemplified by the Apostle Paul, are individuals with a specific calling to proclaim the gospel, focusing on spreading the message of Christ to those who have not heard it before or to new regions. Often involved in missionary work or outreach activities, these evangelists were typically **the most outspoken and confrontational**, as their primary role was to spread the gospel in new and often hostile environments. This mission required a bold and assertive approach to overcome opposition and establish new Christian communities, embodying a profound dedication to their calling.

2. **Shepherds/Pastors (poimenas) & Teachers (didaskalous)**: Once the evangelists herald the divine gospel, visible churches form and shepherds are needed to tend the flock.
   - The term "pastor" comes from the Latin word for "shepherd" and typically refers to those who provide spiritual care and leadership within a congregation. Pastors are often seen as the primary leaders of local churches, focusing on teaching, preaching, and pastoral care. (cf. Eph 4:11; Titus 1:9; 1 Peter 5:2-3; Jeremiah 3:15;23:4; Ac 20:28; 1Tim 3:1-2)

3. **Elders (presbyteroi) & Overseers (episkopoi)**: Without Evangelists, no one would hear the Gospel, and churches would not be formed that need shepherds, elders and overseers.
   - Elders, while also responsible for teaching and shepherding, are typically part of a plural leadership structure within the church. In many traditions, multiple elders share the responsibility of overseeing the congregation, providing a balanced and accountable leadership model. (1Tim 4:14;5:17,19; Titus 1:5; 1Pe 5:1-2; James 5:14; Ac 14:23; 15:6)
      - 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9: These passages provide qualifications for elders, emphasizing their moral character, ability to teach, and manage their households well. Elders must be above reproach, hospitable, not given to drunkenness, and able to exhort and refute those who contradict sound doctrine.
      - 1 Peter 5:1-4: Peter exhorts the elders to shepherd the flock of God willingly and eagerly, serving as examples to the believers. This passage highlights the pastoral aspect of the elder's role.
      - Acts 20:17-38: Paul addresses the elders of the church in Ephesus, reminding them to guard the flock and warning them about false teachers. This reinforces the idea that elders have a protective and doctrinal role in the church.
   - Overseers, or bishops, also played a significant role in maintaining doctrinal purity and church order. They were responsible for addressing heresies and disputes within the church, which often required a confrontational stance to protect the integrity of the faith. Figures like Titus and Timothy, who were overseers appointed by Paul, had responsibilities that included confronting false teachings and ensuring sound doctrine. (Acts 20:28; Philippians 1:1; 1 Timothy 3:1-2; Titus 1:7; 1 Peter 2:25)

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">6Ô∏è‚É£‚ö†Ô∏è Systematic Theologians (Indoctrinators When Pushing 'isms)</span>
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Theologians **ARE NOT** Biblical Language Scholars.
- Systematic Theology, though often well-intentioned, is inherently human (man-made) and thus susceptible to errors. It can introduce flawed frameworks, rigid interpretations, and foster sectarianism. This has led to the proliferation of various doctrinal *'isms* (such as Calvinism, Arminianism, and [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)) and has been a significant factor in causing divisions within the Christian community.
- If a non-sectarian, inter-denominational, and soteriologically & eschatologically agnostic systematic theology were created, that didn't indoctrinate believers into one of the aforementioned *'isms* described above. I would hold it in high regard. If such a work existed, and contained hundreds of scholars, it would still be number 6 on this list but would be much preferable to what exists currently.
- The phrase "[Call No Man Your Teacher](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/)" signifies the imperative to prioritize Christ and sound doctrine above human-created teachings, such as systematic theologies. By endorsing soteriologies like the *'isms* above, eschatological systems and interpretive frameworks such as [dispensationalism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/dispensationalism/), covenant theology, and replacement theology, you are, in essence, elevating these man-made constructs above divine authority. Cease this indoctrination.
- The verse where Paul advises against labeling ourselves after specific leaders is found in 1 Corinthians 1:12-13. It states:

   > "What I mean is that each one of you says, ‚ÄúI follow Paul,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Apollos,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Cephas,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Christ.‚Äù 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (ESV)

   Paul's point here is to emphasize unity in Christ rather than division by allegiance to specific human leaders. If you label yourselves with **Calvin**ism, **Arminian**ism, **Chafer**anism, you are going directly against the word of God and **your doctrine is not sound**. Cease divisions (Jude 1:19).

<!-- - [Call No Man Your Teacher](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/) simply means, not to place man-made teachings like systematic theologies, above Christ & sound doctrine, and that is what you are in-fact doing when you promote man-made frameworks like the *'isms* or the eschatological systems like [dispensationalism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/dispensationalism/), or interpretive frameworks like covenant theology, or replacement theology. Stop indoctrinating. -->

<!-- - Sound doctrine is the prescribed baseline you need, not the man-made wisdom of Systematic Theology (1 Cor 2:13; 1Cor 1:20-21 NLT; 1Tim 4:1). -->

<!-- - You can thank systematic theology for divisions in the body of Christ, denominations, sects, in-fighting, and lately extremism, and torn families.

- I call them indoctrinators, because if you make these people your teachers, you will come out a **cookie cutter** Calvinist, Arminian, [80s Chaferanist](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), but never moderate, never balanced, never fully scriptural. -->

<!-- The hierarchy of authority presented in the article outlines a perspective that emphasizes the primacy of divine guidance and the original biblical texts over human interpretations and systematic theology. Let's evaluate the key points and conclusions to see if they align with a balanced and comprehensive understanding of Christian authority and teaching: -->

The hierarchy of authority as presented in the article aligns with a perspective that emphasizes the primacy of God and the Scriptures over human interpretations and systematic theology. Here are some key points from the article and thoughts on them:

### God / Holy Spirit
1. **God (1 John 2:27)**: 
   - **Conclusion**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> The ultimate authority in Christian belief is God, and the Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in interpreting Scripture and guiding believers. This is foundational and aligns with the core tenets of Christianity. The article asserts that God / Holy Spirit are the ultimate authorities in interpreting Scripture, citing biblical passages to support this view.

### The Holy Scriptures
2. **The Holy Scriptures**:
   - **Original Texts**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> Prioritizing the original Hebrew and Greek texts ensures theological accuracy and faithfulness to the original messages of the Bible.
   - **Critical Text vs. Textus Receptus**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Agree with caution.</span> The article's preference for the Critical Text over the Textus Receptus due to its closer approximation to the original manuscripts **is well-supported by scholarly consensus**. However, the Textus Receptus and translations based on it (like the KJV) have historically played a significant role in the development of Christian thought and should not be entirely dismissed.

### Authoritative Lexicons
3. **The World‚Äôs Most Authoritative Lexicons**:
   - **Conclusion**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> Utilizing The world's most authoritative and reputable lexicons, BDAG and HALOT, are crucial for accurately interpreting biblical languages and understanding Scriptures in their original context. The article emphasizes their paramount importance.
   - **Textual Critics and Scholars**: Recognizing the role of textual critics and scholars in providing reliable translations and interpretations highlights the importance of scholarly work in making the Scriptures accessible and understandable.
   - **The Original Texts and Lexicons**: Emphasizing the authority of the original Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek Scriptures and their lexicons (BDAG, HALOT) reflects a high regard for the original texts of the Bible. This is important for accurate interpretation and understanding.
   

### English Bible Translations
4. **English Bible Translations**:
   - **Hierarchy of Translations**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> The use of reverse interlinear Bibles and translations with extensive notes, such as the NET Bible and ESV Study Bible, supports a more informed and transparent approach to Scripture study. These resources bridge the gap between the original languages and contemporary understanding, providing valuable transparency in translation choices. The hierarchy within English translations‚ÄîReverse Interlinear, Optimal Equivalent, Literal, and Dynamic Meaning Based‚Äîacknowledges varying degrees of fidelity to the original texts and highlights the usefulness of these study tools.

### Pastors and Church Leaders
5. **Evangelists, Shepherds, Pastors, Overseers, & Elders**:
   - **Conclusion**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> The role of church leaders in teaching, guiding, and shepherding the congregation is vital, as emphasized by the biblical references provided. These leaders (pastors, elders, etc.) are expected to adhere to sound doctrine, shepherd their flocks, and maintain spiritual care in alignment with the Biblical mandate.

### Systematic Theologians
6. **Systematic Theologians**:
   - **Conclusion**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> While caution is advised against the potential pitfalls of systematic theology, it is acknowledged that a non-sectarian approach, **devoid** of promoting divisive *'isms* (e.g., Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)), could be preferable. Such a work, if it existed and maintained fidelity to sound biblical doctrine, would offer valuable frameworks for understanding complex theological concepts without the risk of doctrinal division. This perspective highlights the importance of humility and openness to differing theological perspectives while emphasizing the ultimate authority of Scripture. The article's caution against becoming overly indoctrinated by any single theological system **is wise**.
   - The conclusion emphasizes rejecting man-made teachings and frameworks that might overshadow the teachings of Christ and sound biblical doctrine. It critiques systematic theologies, eschatological systems, and interpretive frameworks such as [dispensationalism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/dispensationalism/), covenant theology, and replacement theology for potentially promoting human wisdom over divine revelation (scripture). The call to "stop indoctrinating" underscores a desire to return to a purer form of Christianity, focused solely on scriptural authority without the influence of human-constructed systems. This perspective aligns with a strong emphasis on biblical primacy and a caution against elevating human interpretations to the level of divine truth.


<!-- - While systematic theology offers valuable frameworks for understanding complex theological concepts and organizing biblical teachings coherently, **caution is advised** against rigid interpretations and sectarianism associated with various *'isms* within theological systems (e.g., Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)). The article's caution against becoming overly indoctrinated by any single theological system **is wise**, emphasizing the importance of humility and openness to differing perspectives. While acknowledging the potential pitfalls, it's important not to overlook the contributions of systematic theology to Christian thought. -->
   
### Conclusion

The article prioritizes direct engagement with Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, supported by high-quality scholarly tools, over adherence to rigid theological systems. It warns against the divisiveness of such systems and promotes a more personal, less doctrinally divided approach to faith. The hierarchy it presents prioritizes divine guidance, Scripture, scholarship, and pastoral care, cautioning against excessive reliance on systematic theology for Christian unity.

<a name="Recommended-Leaders" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üßÆ III. Highly Recommended Leaders</a>

These leaders for Christ are highly recommended and **WILL NOT** push the *'isms* mentioned above. For a more complete list see my <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/profile/" style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">extended profile</a>.

- All of these leaders teach correctly on [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) and faith according to scripture, every translator of every Bible, that is, every biblical language scholar, every authoritative Greek lexicon, and centuries of sound doctrine. They represent the academic majority.
- Dr. Carson [does not teach limited atonement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/#carson5.5), and is therefore, **not** a Calvinist. He also teaches a [*compatibilist*](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#carson) view of free will, while Calvinists teach *&lsquo;freedom of inclination,&rsquo;* and is yet again **not** a Calvinist. He is a Reformed leaning moderate or Amyraldian.
- Dr. Heiser has stated many times that, [*&ldquo;we don't need systems,&rdquo;*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vgF6UMdm6Y) and is therefore systemless.
- I recommend Dr. McGrath with one important caveat: he is a theistic evolutionist. Despite this, I find him to be far superior to those who corrupt sound doctrine. Dr. McGrath excels in presenting sound doctrine without any bias or indoctrination into the various *'isms*.
- These are the kind of *&ldquo;teachers&rdquo; (didaskalous)* that will not biasedly teach one specific man-made *'ism*, but rather touch on all understandings and then deep dive into scripture without indoctrinating you into man-made frameworks.

<a name="Conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üßÆ V. Conclusion</a>

After observing the failure of every man-made system, I created this article to guide readers away from flawed man-made systemic theologies and toward the Holy Scriptures and true biblical language scholarship and textual criticism. Unless systematic theologians cease pushing man-made *'isms*, they are indoctrinators not educators. It's important to know the difference between Biblical Scholars who understand the Biblical languages and a Systematic Theologians who do not. 

> And we impart this in words **not taught by human wisdom** but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. 1Cor 2:13 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">20</sup> So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world‚Äôs brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. <sup style="font-weight:bold">21</sup> Since <span style="font-weight:bold">God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom</span>, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe. &mdash; 1 Cor 1:20-21

The Bible teaches us that the world can **never** know God through human wisdom, in other words, Systematic theologies are a bad phase of a bygone era and you're wasting your time with with them; instead, turn your focus to the word of God and prioritize direct engagement with Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, supported by high-quality scholarly tools, over adherence to rigid theological systems. You can achieve this with the <a href="#Recommended-Materials">recommended materials</a> section.

> You call me ‚ÄòTeacher‚Äô and ‚ÄòLord,‚Äô and do so correctly, for that is what I am. &mdash; John 13:13 NET

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">8</sup> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let anyone call you ‚ÄòRabbi,‚Äô for you have only one teacher, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters. <sup style="font-weight:bold">9</sup> And don‚Äôt address anyone here on earth as ‚ÄòFather,‚Äô for only God in heaven is your Father. &mdash; Matthew 23:8-9 NLT

Call no man your teacher for you have only one teacher, Christ Jesus, and all of you are equal as brothers. It's time to pull our heads out of the theological sand. It's time for you to give the Bible another chance. A true teacher does not teach man-made things (**Calvin**ism, **Arminian**ism, [**Chafer**anism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)), but rather God given scripture (Eph 4:11). Lexicons and textual criticism are all you need to bridge the language gap, and Christ is your only teacher. Cease divisions (Jude 1:19).

> "What I mean is that each one of you says, ‚ÄúI follow Paul,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Apollos,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Cephas,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI follow Christ.‚Äù 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (ESV)
