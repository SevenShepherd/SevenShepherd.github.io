<a name="Hierarchy-of-Authority" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üßÆ I. Hierarchy of Authority</a>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">1Ô∏è‚É£ God (1Jn 2:27)</span>
- Christ is the Chief or Great Shepherd (1Pe 5:4; Heb 13:20).
- The Holy Spirit interprets scripture in those he indwells (1Jn 2:27; Jn 14:26;16:13; 2Pe 1:20-21; 1 Cor 2:12-14)

<!--  -->

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">2Ô∏è‚É£ The Holy Scriptures</span>
- **The Biblical Hebrew & Koine Greek Scriptures Themselves**
   1. [**The Critical Text**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/) is the Greek text that scholars have compiled as closest to the original autograph (manuscripts). This is **highly recommended**.
   2. [The Textus Receptus](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/) was composed by a Catholic Priest named Erasmus who was raised Calvinist. The TR was not historically received by all or even by Erasmus himself as there are 27 different and conflicting Textus Receptus‚Äô. Erasmus felt that the doctrine of *Faith Alone* was not supported in the bible in the simplistic way Luther proposed.
      - Erasmus only used around 3 manuscripts to produce the severely anemic Textus Receptus. There are approximately 5000 mss of the Byzantine MT. So it‚Äôs not actually a Majority text bible by methodology.
      - Erasmus lacked the last leaf of Revelation, back translated from a defective copy of the Latin Vulgate, and created 20 errors that don‚Äôt exist in any Greek mss, botching the last 6 verses of revelation.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">3Ô∏è‚É£ The Most Authoritative Lexicons</span>
- These are composed of the brightest **biblical language scholars** on earth, they know philology, linguistics, textual criticism, exegesis, hermeneutics, and specialize in Koine Greek as well as ancient near eastern & semitic languages like Akkadian, Ugaritic, Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic.
- **BDAG** - A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd ed.
- **HALOT** - The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">4Ô∏è‚É£ English Bible Translations </span>
- Without biblical language scholars and the lexicons mentioned above, **we would not have English Bibles**, lexicons, or dictionaries. This is why they take precedence. Keep in mind, I did put the actual scriptures above them.
   1. Reverse Interlinear Bibles
      - The English-Greek Reverse Interlinear New Testament: English Standard Version (ESV)
   2. Optimal Equivalent English Bibles With Full Translators‚Äô notes
      - The [**NET Bible: Full Notes Edition**]() is a completely new, non-sectarian and "inter-denominational," translation of the Bible with 60,932 translators‚Äô notes, completed by more than <a href="https://netbible.com/preface/">25+ of the world‚Äôs foremost biblical scholars</a> from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Columbia, Dallas, etc. This is the largest set of translators‚Äô notes ever created. Textual Basis: Masoretic Text BHS [B19<sup>A</sup>(L)], DSS; NA28, UBS4. Many distinguished scholars.
   3. Literal English Bibles With Studies
      - The [**ESV Study Bible**]() has over 200+ biblical scholars ([100+](https://www.esv.org/translation/) ESV; 95 Study); 9 countries, 20 denominations, 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities, including Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, London, Japan, California, MIT, Duke, Westminister, Dallas, etc. 20,000 study notes, 80,000 cross-references, 200+ charts, 50+ articles, 240 full-color maps and illustrations. Textual Basis: Masoretic Text BHS '83, DSS, LXX, SP, S, Vg; UBS5, NA28. Many distinguished scholars.
   4. Dynamic Meaning Based English Bibles
      - The [**NLT Filament Study Bible**]() has [over 90+ Scholars](https://www.tyndale.com/nlt/meet-the-scholars) in translation from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Columbia, Westminster, Dallas, etc. The study brings even more to the table. In addition to the NLT being the most readable Bible version on earth according to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [analysis](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf), many distinguished scholars.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">5Ô∏è‚É£ Shepherds, Pastors, Overseers, & Elders (The Educators)</span>
- Shepherds, Pastors, Overseers are specifically mentioned (Eph 4:11; 1 Peter 5:2-3; Jeremiah 3:15;23:4; Ac 20:28; 1Tim 3:1-2)
- Elders are specifically mentioned (1Tim 4:14;5:17,19; Titus 1:5,7-9; 1Pe 5:1-2; James 5:14; Ac 14:23; 15:6)
- God-made sound doctrine is the prescribed baseline you need (1Tim 4:1), not the man-made wisdom of Systematic Theology (1Cor 1:20-21 NLT). 
- Love, Unity, the Gospel message (Mt 28:19-20; Mk 16:15), and [sound teachings on repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) prove that these are [**the good Bereans**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/#wilikin) the Bible asks us to be.

<!--  -->

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">6Ô∏è‚É£ Systematic Theologians (The Indoctrinators)</span>
- They're indoctrinators when pushing the 'isms of Christianity.
- Systematic Theology, while for the most part is good-intentioned, it is man-made and error prone, and introduces flawed frameworks, rigid interpretations, and sectarianism. They're single-handedly responsible for all the *'isms* in Christianity (Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), etc.) and most divisions in the body of Christ.
- It's extraordinarily rare to find a systematic theology that is non-sectarian, and which does not push the *'isms* described above. If such a work existed, and contained hundreds of scholars, it would still be number 4 on this list but would be recommended.
- [Call No Man Your Teacher](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/)

<!-- - You can thank systematic theology for divisions in the body of Christ, denominations, sects, in-fighting, and lately extremism, and torn families.

- I call them indoctrinators, because if you make these people your teachers, you will come out a **cookie cutter** Calvinist, Arminian, [80s Chaferanist](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), but never moderate, never balanced, never fully scriptural. -->

<sup style="font-style:italic;">GPT-4-turbo</sup>

The article you referenced presents a detailed hierarchy of authority, with an emphasis on the importance of Scripture and the role of the Holy Spirit in interpreting it. Here's a brief analysis of the key points and the conclusion:

1. **God and the Holy Spirit**: The article asserts that God and the Holy Spirit are the ultimate authorities in interpreting Scripture, citing biblical passages to support this view.

2. **The Holy Scriptures**: It emphasizes the authority of the original biblical texts in Hebrew and Greek and recommends the Critical Text over the Textus Receptus due to its closer approximation to the original manuscripts.

3. **Lexicons and Scholarly Resources**: The article places high importance on authoritative lexicons like BDAG and HALOT for accurate interpretation of biblical languages.

4. **English Bible Translations**: It ranks various English translations based on their adherence to the original texts and the quality of the scholarship behind them, with a preference for translations with extensive notes and scholarly input.

5. **Shepherds, Pastors, Overseers, & Elders**: These roles are recognized as important for teaching and guiding within the church, but they are placed lower in the hierarchy than the Scriptures and authoritative scholarly resources.

6. **Systematic Theologians**: The article is critical of systematic theologians, describing them as "indoctrinators" responsible for creating divisions within Christianity through various theological 'isms.'
   - The article critiques systematic theology for potentially introducing rigid interpretations and sectarianism through various 'isms' (e.g., Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)). While systematic theology aims to provide a coherent framework for understanding Christian beliefs, it can sometimes lead to divisiveness if not approached with humility and openness to differing perspectives.
   - The caution against becoming overly indoctrinated by any single theological system is wise, encouraging believers to seek a balanced and comprehensive understanding of Scripture.

**Conclusion**: The article prioritizes direct engagement with the Scriptures and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, supported by high-quality scholarly tools and resources, over the interpretations and frameworks provided by systematic theology. It suggests that systematic theology can introduce rigid and potentially divisive interpretations, whereas a direct focus on the Scriptures can lead to a purer understanding of Christian teachings.
   - The conclusion of the article reflects a preference for direct engagement with Scripture and reliance on God‚Äôs guidance, supported by scholarly tools, over adherence to rigid theological systems. This perspective values a more personal and less doctrinally divided approach to faith.
   - The hierarchy presented in the article prioritizes direct guidance from God and the authority of the original Scriptures, followed by the work of scholars and translators, and then church leaders. It places systematic theology last, warning against the potential pitfalls of rigid frameworks and sectarianism.
   - Ultimately, this hierarchy encourages a balance between divine guidance, scriptural authority, scholarly work, and pastoral care, while urging caution in the use of systematic theology to avoid unnecessary divisions within the Christian faith.

<!-- **Agreement**:  -->

<!-- - **Strengths**: The article rightly emphasizes the supreme authority of God and the Scriptures. The recognition of the importance of scholarly tools for accurate interpretation is also commendable. -->

<!-- - **Criticisms**: The blanket critique of systematic theology seems overly harsh. While it is true that systematic theology can sometimes introduce rigid frameworks, it also plays a crucial role in helping believers understand and organize biblical teachings coherently. Many systematic theologians strive to be faithful to the Scriptures and contribute positively to the church's understanding of doctrine. -->

<!-- Overall, while I appreciate the article's emphasis on the authority of Scripture and the need for careful interpretation, I believe it could benefit from a more balanced view of systematic theology, recognizing its value alongside its potential pitfalls. -->

<!-- The hierarchy of authority as presented in the article aligns with a perspective that emphasizes the primacy of God and the Scriptures over human interpretations and systematic theology. Here are some key points from the article and thoughts on them:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **God (1 John 2:27)**
   - Agreeing that God is the ultimate authority is foundational to Christian belief. The reference to 1 John 2:27 emphasizes the anointing from God that teaches believers, highlighting direct divine guidance.
   - Placing God at the highest level of authority is consistent with Christian belief that God's will and guidance are supreme. The verse cited (1 John 2:27) speaks of the anointing teaching believers, which underscores the importance of direct guidance from God through the Holy Spirit.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **The Holy Scriptures** Placing the original Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek Scriptures as the highest authority within written sources is essential for accurate theological understanding. Using authoritative lexicons and works of textual critics ensures that translations and interpretations are as close to the original texts as possible.
   - **The Original Texts and Lexicons**: Emphasizing the authority of the original Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek Scriptures and their lexicons (BDAG, HALOT) reflects a high regard for the original texts of the Bible. This is important for accurate interpretation and understanding.
   - **Textual Critics and Scholars**: Recognizing the role of textual critics and scholars in providing reliable translations and interpretations highlights the importance of scholarly work in making the Scriptures accessible and understandable.
   - **English Bibles and Study Tools**: The emphasis on the use of reverse interlinear Bibles and English translations with extensive translators‚Äô notes, like the NET Bible and ESV Study Bible, is valuable. These resources help bridge the gap between the original languages and contemporary understanding while providing transparency in translation choices.
   
      The hierarchy within English translations (Reverse Interlinear, Optimal Equivalent, Literal, and Dynamic Meaning Based) acknowledges the varying degrees of fidelity to the original texts and the usefulness of study tools like the NET Bible and ESV Study Bible.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Shepherds, Pastors, Overseers, & Elders (The Educators)**
   - The role of pastors and church leaders in spreading the Gospel and maintaining sound doctrine is crucial. The article's distinction between sound doctrine and systematic theology is significant. Sound doctrine refers to core Christian beliefs derived directly from Scripture, while systematic theology involves organized frameworks that can sometimes lead to denominational divisions.
   - The importance of church leaders (pastors, elders, etc.) in teaching and guiding the congregation is well-supported by the cited scriptures. These leaders are expected to adhere to sound doctrine and shepherd their flocks with love and unity, aligning with the Biblical mandate.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Systematic Theologians (The Indoctrinators when pushing ‚Äòisms)**
   - The article critiques systematic theology for potentially introducing rigid interpretations and sectarianism through various 'isms' (e.g., Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)). While systematic theology aims to provide a coherent framework for understanding Christian beliefs, it can sometimes lead to divisiveness if not approached with humility and openness to differing perspectives.
   - The caution against becoming overly indoctrinated by any single theological system is wise, encouraging believers to seek a balanced and comprehensive understanding of Scripture.

### Conclusion

The conclusion of the article reflects a preference for direct engagement with Scripture and reliance on God‚Äôs guidance, supported by scholarly tools, over adherence to rigid theological systems. This perspective values a more personal and less doctrinally divided approach to faith.

The hierarchy presented in the article prioritizes direct guidance from God and the authority of the original Scriptures, followed by the work of scholars and translators, and then church leaders. It places systematic theology last, warning against the potential pitfalls of rigid frameworks and sectarianism.

**Agreement and Considerations**:
- I agree with the emphasis on God's ultimate authority and the primary importance of the Scriptures in their original languages.
- Recognizing the crucial role of scholars and textual critics in providing accurate translations is essential for a sound understanding of the Bible.
- The role of church leaders as educators who adhere to sound doctrine is also important for the health of the church.
- While systematic theology can be helpful for organizing and understanding theological concepts, it's important to approach it critically and be aware of its limitations and potential for division.

Ultimately, this hierarchy encourages a balance between divine guidance, scriptural authority, scholarly work, and pastoral care, while urging caution in the use of systematic theology to avoid unnecessary divisions within the Christian faith. -->
