<a name="Hierarchy-of-Authority" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üßÆ I. Hierarchy of Authority</a>

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">1Ô∏è‚É£ God (1Jn 2:27)</span>
- Christ is the Chief or Great Shepherd (1Pe 5:4; Heb 13:20).
- The Holy Spirit interprets scripture in those he indwells (1Jn 2:27; Jn 14:26;16:13; 2Pe 1:20-21; 1 Cor 2:12-14)

<!-- 
- *&ldquo;... **the NT has about 5,600 extant copies in Greek alone**, ... **10,000 in latin**, **several thousand copies** ... **several hundred thousand** patristic **quotations** ...&rdquo;* &mdash; Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Ph.D., Dallas Theological Seminary) paraphrased.
- *&ldquo; If you could stack up all handwritten manuscripts of the New Testament‚ÄîGreek, Syriac, Latin, Coptic, all languages‚Äîhow tall would the stack be? ... I have said in many lectures that it would be the **equivalent of c. 4 & 1/2 Empire State Buildings stacked on top of each other**.&rdquo;* &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Ph.D., Dallas Theological Seminary)](https://danielbwallace.com/tag/number-of-new-testament-manuscripts/) 
-->

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">2Ô∏è‚É£ The Holy Scriptures</span>
- **The Biblical Hebrew & Koine Greek Scriptures Themselves**
   1. [**The Critical Text**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/) is the Greek text that scholars have compiled as closest to the original autograph (manuscripts). This is **highly recommended**. (ESV, NET, NLT, LEB, LSB, NASB).
   2. The Majority Text (WEB)
   3. [The Textus Receptus](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/) was composed by a Catholic Priest named Erasmus who was raised Calvinist. (KJV, NKJV).
      - The TR was not historically received by all or even by Erasmus himself as there are 27 different and conflicting Textus Receptus‚Äô. 
      - Erasmus felt that the doctrine of *Faith Alone* was not supported in the bible in the simplistic way Luther proposed.
      - Erasmus only used around 3 manuscripts to produce the severely anemic Textus Receptus. There are approximately 5000 mss of the Byzantine MT. So it‚Äôs not actually Majority text by methodology.
      - Erasmus lacked the last leaf of Revelation, back translated from a defective copy of the Latin Vulgate, and created 20 errors that don‚Äôt exist in any Greek mss, botching the last 6 verses of revelation, the very place the bible warns not to get wrong! **Not Recommended**

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">3Ô∏è‚É£ The World's Most Authoritative Lexicons</span>
- These are composed of the brightest **biblical language scholars** on earth, they know philology, linguistics, textual criticism, exegesis, hermeneutics, and specialize in Koine Greek as well as ancient near eastern & semitic languages like Akkadian, Ugaritic, Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic.
- **BDAG** - A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd ed.
- **HALOT** - The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">4Ô∏è‚É£ English Bible Translations </span>
- Without biblical language scholars and the lexicons mentioned above, **we would not have English Bibles**, lexicons, or dictionaries. This is why they take precedence. Keep in mind, I did put the actual scriptures above them.
   1. Reverse Interlinear Bibles
      - The English-Greek Reverse Interlinear New Testament: English Standard Version (ESV)
   2. Optimal Equivalent Bibles With Full Translators‚Äô notes
      - The [**NET Bible: Full Notes Edition**]() is a completely new, non-sectarian and "inter-denominational," translation of the Bible with 60,932 translators‚Äô notes, completed by more than <a href="https://netbible.com/preface/">25+ of the world‚Äôs foremost biblical scholars</a> from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Columbia, Dallas, etc. This is the largest set of translators‚Äô notes ever created. Textual Basis: Masoretic Text BHS [B19<sup>A</sup>(L)], DSS; NA28, UBS4. Many distinguished scholars.
   3. Formal Equivalent Bibles With Studies
      - The [**ESV Study Bible**]() has over 200+ biblical scholars ([100+](https://www.esv.org/translation/) ESV; 95 Study); 9 countries, 20 denominations, 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities, including Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, London, Japan, California, MIT, Duke, Westminister, Dallas, etc. 20,000 study notes, 80,000 cross-references, 200+ charts, 50+ articles, 240 full-color maps and illustrations. Textual Basis: Masoretic Text BHS '83, DSS, LXX, SP, S, Vg; UBS5, NA28. Many distinguished scholars.
   4. Dynamic Equivalent Meaning Based Bibles
      - The [**NLT Filament Study Bible**]() has [over 90+ Scholars](https://www.tyndale.com/nlt/meet-the-scholars) in translation from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Columbia, Westminster, Dallas, etc. The study brings even more to the table. In addition to the NLT being the most readable Bible version on earth according to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [analysis](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf), many distinguished scholars.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">5Ô∏è‚É£ Evangelists, Shepherds, Pastors, Overseers, & Elders (The Educators of God's Word)</span>

- Without biblical language scholars we wouldn't have English Bibles, lexicons, or dictionaries, and without these tools we would not have Shepherds who know the scriptures, or Evangelists who spread the Gospel.
- **Evangelists (euangelistas)**: Evangelists are those who have a specific calling to proclaim the gospel, often focusing on spreading the message of Christ to those who have not heard it before or to new regions. They might be involved in missionary work or outreach activities. (cf. Eph 4:11; 2 Tim 4:5; Mt 28:19-20; Mk 16:15; Romans 10:14-15.)
- **Shepherds/Pastors (poimenas) & Teachers (didaskalous)**: The term "pastor" comes from the Latin word for "shepherd" and typically refers to those who provide spiritual care and leadership within a congregation. Pastors are often seen as the primary leaders of local churches, focusing on teaching, preaching, and pastoral care. (cf. Eph 4:11; Titus 1:9; 1 Peter 5:2-3; Jeremiah 3:15;23:4; Ac 20:28; 1Tim 3:1-2)
- **Elders (presbyteroi) & Overseers (episkopoi)**: Elders, while also responsible for teaching and shepherding, are typically part of a plural leadership structure within the church. In many traditions, multiple elders share the responsibility of overseeing the congregation, providing a balanced and accountable leadership model. 
   - Verses mentioning elders: 1Tim 4:14;5:17,19; Titus 1:5; 1Pe 5:1-2; James 5:14; Ac 14:23; 15:6
   - Verses mentioning overseers: Acts 20:28; Philippians 1:1; 1 Timothy 3:1-2; Titus 1:7; 1 Peter 2:25
   - 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9: These passages provide qualifications for elders, emphasizing their moral character, ability to teach, and manage their households well. Elders must be above reproach, hospitable, not given to drunkenness, and able to exhort and refute those who contradict sound doctrine.
   - 1 Peter 5:1-4: Peter exhorts the elders to shepherd the flock of God willingly and eagerly, serving as examples to the believers. This passage highlights the pastoral aspect of the elder's role.
   - Acts 20:17-38: Paul addresses the elders of the church in Ephesus, reminding them to guard the flock and warning them about false teachers. This reinforces the idea that elders have a protective and doctrinal role in the church.
- Love, Unity, the Gospel message (Mt 28:19-20; Mk 16:15; Romans 10:14-15), and [sound teachings on repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) prove that these are [**the good Bereans**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/#wilikin) the Bible asks us to be.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">6Ô∏è‚É£‚ö†Ô∏è Systematic Theologians (The Indoctrinators of Man-Made Systems)</span>
- Sound doctrine is the prescribed baseline you need, not the man-made wisdom of Systematic Theology (1 Cor 2:13; 1Cor 1:20-21 NLT; 1Tim 4:1).
- Systematic Theology, though often well-intentioned, is inherently human (man-made) and thus susceptible to errors. It can introduce flawed frameworks, rigid interpretations, and foster sectarianism. This has led to the proliferation of various doctrinal *'isms* (such as Calvinism, Arminianism, and [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)) and has been a significant factor in causing divisions within the Christian community.
- It's extraordinarily rare to find a systematic theology that is non-sectarian, and which does not push the *'isms* described above. If such a work existed, and contained hundreds of scholars, it would still be number 6 on this list but would be much preferable to what exists currently.
- [Call No Man Your Teacher](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/)

<!-- - You can thank systematic theology for divisions in the body of Christ, denominations, sects, in-fighting, and lately extremism, and torn families.

- I call them indoctrinators, because if you make these people your teachers, you will come out a **cookie cutter** Calvinist, Arminian, [80s Chaferanist](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), but never moderate, never balanced, never fully scriptural. -->

### The Holy Scriptures
2. **The Holy Scriptures**:
   - **Original Texts**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> Prioritizing the original Hebrew and Greek texts ensures theological accuracy and faithfulness to the original messages of the Bible.
   - **Critical Text vs. Textus Receptus**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Agree with caution.</span> The article's preference for the Critical Text over the Textus Receptus due to its closer approximation to the original manuscripts **is well-supported by scholarly consensus**. However, the Textus Receptus and translations based on it (like the KJV) have historically played a significant role in the development of Christian thought and should not be entirely dismissed.

### Authoritative Lexicons
3. **The World‚Äôs Most Authoritative Lexicons**:
   - **Conclusion**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> Utilizing The world's most authoritative and reputable lexicons, BDAG and HALOT, are crucial for accurately interpreting biblical languages and understanding Scriptures in their original context.

   - **Hierarchy of Translations**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> The use of reverse interlinear Bibles and translations with extensive notes, such as the NET Bible and ESV Study Bible, supports a more informed and transparent approach to Scripture study. These resources bridge the gap between the original languages and contemporary understanding, providing valuable transparency in translation choices. The hierarchy within English translations‚ÄîReverse Interlinear, Optimal Equivalent, Literal, and Dynamic Meaning Based‚Äîacknowledges varying degrees of fidelity to the original texts and highlights the usefulness of these study tools.

### Pastors and Church Leaders
5. **Evangelists, Shepherds, Pastors, Overseers, & Elders**:
   - **Conclusion**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> The role of church leaders in teaching, guiding, and shepherding the congregation is vital, as emphasized by the biblical references provided. These leaders (pastors, elders, etc.) are expected to adhere to sound doctrine, shepherd their flocks, and maintain spiritual care in alignment with the Biblical mandate.

### Systematic Theologians
6. **Systematic Theologians**:
   - **Conclusion**: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Agree.</span> While caution is advised against the potential pitfalls of systematic theology, it is acknowledged that a non-sectarian approach, **devoid** of promoting divisive *'isms* (e.g., Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)), could be preferable. Such a work, if it existed and maintained fidelity to sound biblical doctrine, would offer valuable frameworks for understanding complex theological concepts without the risk of doctrinal division. This perspective highlights the importance of humility and openness to differing theological perspectives while emphasizing the ultimate authority of Scripture."
   - While systematic theology offers valuable frameworks for understanding complex theological concepts and organizing biblical teachings coherently, **caution is advised** against rigid interpretations and sectarianism associated with various *'isms* within theological systems (e.g., Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)). The article's caution against becoming overly indoctrinated by any single theological system **is wise**, emphasizing the importance of humility and openness to differing perspectives. While acknowledging the potential pitfalls, it's important not to overlook the contributions of systematic theology to Christian thought.
   
### Conclusion

The article prioritizes direct engagement with Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit, supported by high-quality scholarly tools, over adherence to rigid theological systems. It warns against the divisiveness of such systems and promotes a more personal, less doctrinally divided approach to faith.
