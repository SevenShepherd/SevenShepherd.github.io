- <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">1Ô∏è‚É£ God (1Jn 2:27)</span>
- <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">2Ô∏è‚É£ The Holy Scriptures</span>
   1. **The Biblical Hebrew & Koine Greek Scriptures Themselves**
   2. **The Most Authoritative Greek Lexicons**
      - Compositions by hundreds of textual critics
      - BDAG - A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd ed.
      - HALOT - The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament
   3. **Scholarly Textual Critics & Translators**

   4. **English Bibles**
      1. Reverse Interlinear Bibles
         - The English-Greek Reverse Interlinear New Testament: English Standard Version (ESV)
      2. Optimal Equivalent English Bibles With Full Translators‚Äô notes
         - The [**NET Bible: Full Notes Edition**]() is a completely new, non-sectarian and "inter-denominational," translation of the Bible with 60,932 translators‚Äô notes, completed by more than <a href="https://netbible.com/preface/">25+ of the world‚Äôs foremost biblical scholars</a> from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Columbia, Dallas, etc. This is the largest set of translators‚Äô notes ever created. Textual Basis: Masoretic Text BHS [B19<sup>A</sup>(L)], DSS; NA28, UBS4. Many distinguished scholars.
      3. Literal English Bibles With Studies

In addition to the NLT being the most readable Bible version on earth according to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [analysis](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf), many distinguished scholars.
- <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">3Ô∏è‚É£ Shepherds, Overseers, & Elders</span>
   - Shepherds & Overseers are specifically mentioned (Eph 4:11; 1 Peter 5:2-3; Jeremiah 3:15;23:4; Ac 20:28; 1Tim 3:1-2)
   - Elders are specifically mentioned (1Tim 4:14;5:17,19; Titus 1:5,7-9; 1Pe 5:1-2; James 5:14; Ac 14:23; 15:6)
   - God-made sound doctrine is the prescribed baseline you need (1Tim 4:1), not the man-made wisdom of Systematic Theology (1Cor 1:20-21 NLT). 
   - Love, Unity, the Gospel message (Mt 28:19-20; Mk 16:15), and [sound teachings on repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) prove that these are [**the good Bereans**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/#wilikin) the Bible asks us to be.
- <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">4Ô∏è‚É£ Systematic Theologians (indoctrinators when pushing 'isms)</span>
   - Systematic Theology, while for the most part is good-intentioned, it is man-made and error prone, and introduces flawed frameworks, rigid interpretations, and sectarianism. They're single-handedly responsible for all the *'isms* in Christianity (Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), etc.) and most divisions in the body of Christ.
   - [Call No Man Your Teacher](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/call-no-man-your-teacher/)

<!-- - You can thank systematic theology for divisions in the body of Christ, denominations, sects, in-fighting, and lately extremism, and torn families.

- I call them indoctrinators, because if you make these people your teachers, you will come out a **cookie cutter** Calvinist, Arminian, [80s Chaferanist](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), but never moderate, never balanced, never fully scriptural. -->

The hierarchy of authority as presented in the article aligns with a perspective that emphasizes the primacy of God and the Scriptures over human interpretations and systematic theology. Here are some key points from the article and thoughts on them:

1. **God (1Jn 2:27)**: Agreeing that God is the ultimate authority is foundational to Christian belief. The reference to 1 John 2:27 emphasizes the anointing from God that teaches believers, highlighting direct divine guidance.

2. **The Holy Scriptures**: Placing the original Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek Scriptures as the highest authority within written sources is essential for accurate theological understanding. Using authoritative lexicons and works of textual critics ensures that translations and interpretations are as close to the original texts as possible.

3. **English Bibles and Translators‚Äô Notes**: The emphasis on the use of reverse interlinear Bibles and English translations with extensive translators‚Äô notes, like the NET Bible and ESV Study Bible, is valuable. These resources help bridge the gap between the original languages and contemporary understanding while providing transparency in translation choices.

4. **Pastors, Shepherds, & Elders**: The role of pastors and church leaders in spreading the Gospel and maintaining sound doctrine is crucial. The article's distinction between sound doctrine and systematic theology is significant. Sound doctrine refers to core Christian beliefs derived directly from Scripture, while systematic theology involves organized frameworks that can sometimes lead to denominational divisions.

<!-- 5. **Systematic Theologians**: The article's critique of systematic theologians and their role in creating divisions within the body of Christ is a contentious point. While systematic theology can lead to rigid interpretations and sectarianism, it also provides structured understanding and helps address complex theological questions. The caution against becoming overly indoctrinated by any single theological system is wise, encouraging believers to seek a balanced and comprehensive understanding of Scripture. -->

The conclusion of the article reflects a preference for direct engagement with Scripture and reliance on God‚Äôs guidance, supported by scholarly tools, over adherence to rigid theological systems. This perspective values a more personal and less doctrinally divided approach to faith. Whether one agrees with this conclusion might depend on their views on the role of theology in understanding and living out their faith.
