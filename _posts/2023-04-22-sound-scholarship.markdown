<!-- > Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. &mdash; Proverbs 16:18 ESV (English Standard Version) -->

The cults come to mind when considering this topic, as every one of them I've talked to has absolutely zero scholarship behind their translation or doctrine. If you can't site a majority of scholarship on a topic, but are relying on cherry picking or no scholarship whatsoever, you are what is spoken of in second peter.

<!-- Some movements within Christianity that teach Greek incorrectly are also reminiscent. -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the **untaught and unstable** distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction. &mdash; 2 Peter 3:16 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible)

- [Dr. Ron Rhodes (Th.D., Dallas)]()

> **In all his letters** shows awareness of some kind of collection of Paul‚Äôs letters, with the number unspecified here. **Some things ‚Ä¶ hard to understand** does not say that everything in Paul‚Äôs letters is hard to understand, nor does it say that anything is ‚Äúimpossible to understand,‚Äù but it does imply that correctly interpreting some hard passages of Scripture requires much effort and God-given wisdom. **The ignorant and unstable twist** Paul‚Äôs teachings **as they do the other Scriptures**, implying that Paul‚Äôs writings were also considered Scripture in NT times, on the same level of divine authority as the OT Scripture. Greek graphƒì, here translated ‚ÄúScriptures,‚Äù occurs 51 times in the NT, and every time it refers to the canonical OT Scripture, and not to any other writings, except that twice (here and 1 Tim. 5:18) some NT writings are also included. This indicates that NT books written or authorized by Christ‚Äôs apostles were recognized, at a very early date, to be God‚Äôs Word.
