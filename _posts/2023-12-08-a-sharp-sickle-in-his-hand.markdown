> 14 Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, ‚ÄúPut in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.‚Äù 16 So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the earth was reaped. ‚Äî Jesus in Revelation 14:14-16 ESV
