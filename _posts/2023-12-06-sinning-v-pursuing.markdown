# ‚ÄúEveryone Sins‚Äù Is A Common Excuse To Ignore Scripture, But The Bible Teaches That Not Everyone Pursues Lifestyles Of Indulgent Sin. In Fact There Is No Such Thing As A Born Again Believer Who Does

Every one sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10) in the sense that we're not perfect and will struggle against our sin nature, but there is no Christian who pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin. Many people will use this as an excuse for antinomianism (Jd 4 NET), they depart from scripture when they do this.

<!-- > <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Little children, let no one deceive you. ... Whoever makes a practice of sinning <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is of the devil</span>, ... <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">No one born of God</span> makes a practice of sinning ...</span> &mdash; 1 John 3:7-9 ESV -->

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> Little children, let no one deceive you. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil</span>, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">No one born of God makes a practice of sinning</span>, for God's<sup style="color:#A8A8A8">[a]</sup> seed abides in him; and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">he cannot keep on sinning</span>, because he has been born of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">By this it is evident</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">who are the children of God</span>, and <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">who are the children of the devil</span>: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. &mdash; 1 John 3:6-10 ESV -->

- üêâ The Serpent says, *&ldquo;Surely you will not die&rdquo;* (Gen. 3:4 NET).
- üçá God says, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">*&ldquo;No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.&rdquo;*</span> (Luke 13:3 ESV) 
    - <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Little children, let no one deceive you. ... Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, ... No one born of God makes a practice of sinning ...&rdquo;*</span> (1 John 3:7-9 ESV)
- üßë Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience.

Christians do not ‚Äúpractice‚Äù sin (1 Jn 3:6-10,31; 5:18; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6), abuse grace as a license to sin (Jd 4 NET), or remain in lifestyles of indulgent sin (Ro 6:1-2,15; Gal 5:19-21). If they do, they give strong evidence of false profession (1Jn 2:4; Mt 10:38; Mt 18:3 NLT; Lk 9:23,62). Here is the reason, because Christians are divinely enabled not to pursue indulgent lifestyles of sin, they're protected from it.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. &mdash; 1 John 5:18 ESV

So, will you listen? Lean not unto your own understanding (Proverbs 3:5), just listen to Christ (Lk 13:3; Mt 4:17). It's time to stop fighting against scripture. Surrender to the Lord of Destiny (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
