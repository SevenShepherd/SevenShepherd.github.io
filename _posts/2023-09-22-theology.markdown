<a name="deduce" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.1 Deducing The Correct Answer</a>

- Q1. Do you believe in the devil? 
    - A1. Every Christian would respond: yes.
- Q2. Do you believe in God?
    - A2. Every Christian would respond: yes.
- Q3. Does believing in the devil make you a satanist?
    - A3. Every Christian would respond: no.
- Q4. Does believing in God make you a Christian?
    - A4. This is where confusion arises.

<!--  -->

Let's define what "Belief in" actually means.

- Q5.  The story goes something like this (based on true events): A witch astral projects to harm a Christian family, she's prevented from doing so because there are angels surrounding and protecting the family's home, clearly this witch believes in God and angels, is she saved?
    - A5. The answer is obviously no, because there is no "trust in," "reliance on," or "approval of" God, only intellectual assent to facts. So while there may be notitia (‘knowledge’) and even assensus (‘agreement’), there is no fiducia (‘trust and reliance’).

<!--  -->

I think [Packer](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#packer) describes this best when he delineates that saving faith is composed of three essential elements: notitia, assensus, and fiducia. "Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14)."

- The latin term notitia means ‘knowledge’ and refers to an "acquaintance with the content of the gospel"
- Assensus or ‘agreement’ means "recognition that the gospel is true"
- Fiducia means ‘trust and reliance’ and it speaks of the "personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one’s own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3." 

> To "believe that" is to have the belief that Christianity is true; to "believe in" is to put your trust in Jesus. To get your moral transgressions forgiven, you have to go from "belief that" to "belief in" because "belief that" alone won't save you. &mdash; Dr. Frank Turek (D.Min., Southern Evangelical Seminary)

**This is the historic protestant understanding and teaching of faith and I believe this is the correct conclusion.**

<!-- > Reformed theology analysed faith as notitia (‘knowledge’, i.e. acquaintance with the content of the gospel), plus assensus (‘agreement’, i.e. recognition that the gospel is true), plus fiducia (‘trust and reliance’, i.e. personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one’s own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3). Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14). &mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford) -->

<!-- One does not need to be reformed to be a historic protestant, any more than he has to be a 5-point Calvinist in order to be reformed. The first phase of the reformation was amyraldian (moderate). -->

<a name="lexicons" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.2 Lexicons & Dictionaries</a>

The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (**TDNT "Kittel"**) defines the underlying greek word **pisteúō**: 

> 4\. pisteúō means **&ldquo;to trust&rdquo; (also &ldquo;to obey&rdquo;)**, &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; (words), and in the passive &ldquo;to enjoy confidence&rdquo; (cf. the later sense &ldquo;to confide in&rdquo;).

We can also double check with the Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (**BDAG**), **the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon**. We can see that John 3:16 falls under the second meaning described below:

> **2 to entrust oneself to an entity in complete confidence, believe (in), trust,** w. implication of total commitment to the one who is trusted. In our lit. God and Christ are objects of this type of faith that relies on their power and nearness to help, in addition to being convinced that their revelations or disclosures are true.

<!-- A quick glance at [**Mounce**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#mounce) reveals the following:

> An accurate understanding of the use of metanoeo and metanoia in the NT is essential to grasp the gospel message, because **it does not allow for someone to obtain salvation simply by intellectually believing that Jesus is the Son of God without repenting of sins and turning to live for him.** See NIDNTT-A,367. -->

<a name="james2:19" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.3 Teachings Of The Apostle James</a>

James points out that *intellectual assent to facts* is a type of belief that [**even a demon can exercise**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#carson). Colloquially: you believe in God? Whoop-dee-doo, even the demons can exercise that kind of faith, but they aren't saved! Where's your "trust in," "reliance on," God? Where's your fiducia?

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> You say you have faith, for you believe that **there is one God**.<span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[a]</span> Good for you! Even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. &mdash; James 2:19 NLT

I think [Grudem](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#grudem) describes this best when he delineates James teaching:

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus’ life and saving works, for James says, “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!” (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. — Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge), Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. pp. 861-862.

Here is some logic to consider:

<!-- Jn 6:29; Phil 1:29; -->

1. James 2:19 states that demons are believers.
2. James 2:26 equates this kind of belief (assent) with a dead or superficial faith.
3. Christians then are to have a living/saving faith (fiducia and &ldquo;resulting&rdquo; obedience).
4. Demons therefore have a "dead faith," the kind we're not supposed to have.
5. If demons cannot repent, and repentance is granted (Ac 11:18; 2Ti 2:25), then they're by definition unrepentant as well.
6. A dead faith is a faith that even a demon can exercise.
7. A living faith is a faith only the elect can exercise (Jn 6:29; Phil 1:29)

The elect are believers. This statement takes no stance on the conditionality or unconditionality of election in this section.

<a name="dead" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.4 The False Assurance of a Dead Faith</a>

False assurance can also be examined and avoided by understanding the following verses: Mt 18:3; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5; Luke 6:46, and subsequently Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32; Mt 7:21-23. False assurance speaks of &ldquo;those who are not saved, but have the assurance that they are saved.&rdquo;

> “Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do what I tell you? &mdash; Luke 6:46

**These warnings were written to people** who would be listening to the New Testament epistles as they were read aloud **in New Testament Churches** (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11; 2 Cor. 13:5; Heb. 3:12; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 3:6, 9-10; 14).

Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Do you not know that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">the unrighteous <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">will not</span> inherit the kingdom of God</span>?

But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. &mdash; 1 Cor. 6:9-11 NET

The Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

> Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith. &mdash; 2 Cor. 13:5 NLT

<a name="saving" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.2 Saving Faith Is Salvific</a>

**I dedicated an entire [article](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) to this topic. Please [read](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) it.**

<a name="alone" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.1 By Grace Through Faith Alone</a>

Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). [Sola fide](/assets/images/solas.jpg). 

<!-- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God and good works that "follow after" justification. -->

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me**. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.” &mdash; John 14:21 NLT (cf. Jn 14:15).

While works definitely **do not** save us, they do spring forth from a true and lively faith.

- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
- Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
- The practice of unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (1 Cor. 5:12-13; Luke 17:3-4)
- Those who practice lifelong habitual sin are likely self-deceived (James 1:22; 2 Pe 2:21-22) and will not inherit the kingdom of God (Mt 18:3; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5 ... + Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32)
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (Mt 10:38; 16:24; Lk 9:23,62; 14:27; Mk 8:34... Mt 3:10; 25:30; Jn 15:8 ESV)
- True Christians love God by obeying him (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4).
- True Christians love other believers (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10,14; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
- The Bible teaches us to live Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; 2 Pe 2:21-22).
- The teaching of obedience to God after justification is not burdensome, in fact it's a reason for joy (1 Jn 5:3-4; Jn 15:10-11).

These quotations make clear that this teaching is sound, neither legalistic, nor antinomian.

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)

> **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.** Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‘faith apart from observing the law’, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">if ‘good works’ (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith</span>, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">justifying faith (fiducia) is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not yet ours</span></span>. &mdash; [Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford), Concise Theology. Chapter 59 Works. p. 174.](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo)

<a name="repentance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.2 Repentance Is An Immediate Fruit Of Genuine Saving Faith</a>

Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith, and is defined as a turning away from sin to God that leads to salvation and eternal life. Unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (2Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18; Acts 26:15-20; Acts 3:19; Luke 17:3-4; 1Cor. 5:12-13)

- Repentance is **a turning away from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance is necessary (Lk 13:3) **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5)

<a name="living" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.3 Living Faith v. Dead Faith</a>

James rejects salvation by dead faith (James 2:14-26). Put another way, James rejects salvation by superficial faith, because faith is the instrument by which we lay hold of grace. Paul tells us to test for genuine faith, or a living faith, because Christ lives in you (2 Cor. 13:5).

<!-- There are two verses in the Bible that talk about the difference between a dead faith and a living faith. The first such instance is in James 2:14-26 where James implies that a *dead faith* is not the kind of faith that saves.  -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if **someone** says he has faith but does not have works? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Can that faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">save him</span>?</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> So also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">faith by itself, if it does not have works, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:14-17 ESV

James goes on to say that *intellectual assent to facts* is a type of belief that **even a demon can exercise**. We can conclude that if it's not a dead faith that saves, then the faith that justifies is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive, and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus’ life and saving works, for James says, “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!” (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. — Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge), Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. pp. 861-862.

We can also draw this same conclusion from second corinthians. We can see that the Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

> Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test! &mdash; 2 Corinthians 13:5

The reason I have spent the time explaining the difference between a dead faith and a living faith is to describe how people fall into the heresy of antinomianism. It would seem there is a growing concern over this form of false assurance; there are actually teachers out there who violate the message of the Apostles (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62), falsely teaching that God's grace allows us to live immoral lives, which the Bible does not support in any way, shape, or form.

It's true that we are saved by grace and faith alone (Eph 2:8-10), but it's also true that saving faith results in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that follow after justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).

When you profess Christ truly, you walk as he walked. We're not saved by this walk, but that's what happens as a result of a genuine profession of faith. The answer to all of these questions should be: Yes!

1. Are you saved according to Eph. 2:8-10?
2. Do you love God according to John 14:15,21?
3. Do you see the fruits (Gal. 5:22-23) and evidences (James 2:14-26) of a true and lively faith?

<!-- We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only have you proven that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but that your profession of faith was false (1Jn 2:3-6).  -->

We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only are you showing evidence that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but you're also showing evidence that your profession of faith is false (1Jn 2:3-6). Make sure your heart has not betrayed you (Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9), examine your faith to see if it is genuine (2Cor. 13:5 NLT).

> **Biblical faith is evidence-based.**... **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing. ... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*. p. 136, 218, 313.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#lennox)

<a name="legal" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.4 Legalistic False Assurance</a>

Jesus warning on the sermon on the mount taught that many would come to him in the last days saying &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; these people come to Jesus fully assured that they belong to him, and he rejects them, thereby exposing their assurance as counterfeit. Let's examine why that is the case:

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ <span style="color:#009933;">will enter the kingdom of heaven</span>, but <span style="color:#009933;">the one who does the will of my Father</span> who is in heaven. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord,</span> <span style="color:orangered;">did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?</span>’ <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">And then will I declare to them, ‘I never [knew](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#foreknew) you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:21-23

Here we can identify three types of individuals exhibiting assent to facts (notitia and assensus) but not "trust and reliance" (fiducia) that defines genuine saving faith.

1. <span style="color:orangered;">&ldquo;**did we not** prophesy in your name&rdquo;</span>
2. <span style="color:orangered;">&ldquo;and cast out demons in your name&rdquo;</span>
3. <span style="color:orangered;">&ldquo;and do many mighty **works** in your name?&rdquo;</span>

These all seem to me, to be legalistic pleas. They are all appealing to God, their works, as a reason why they should be admitted into heaven. Instead they should have had "trust and reliance" upon God's grace through faith only. This is why it's important to teach <span style="color:#009933;">&ldquo;resulting&rdquo; obedience</span> to God instead of <span style="color:orangered;">&ldquo;including&rdquo; obedience</span>. **You cannot merit your own salvation, and if you rely on your own efforts you're doomed.**

Some of my earliest memories with Christian praise music is with my Dad, and also, on a separate occasion, standing next to my Grandfather in the church pews while the choir sang beautiful psalms and hymns to the Lord. As time progresses the church seems to fall further and further away from the heartfelt praise music that **the Bible specifically tells us will be in churches**.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> addressing one another in **psalms and hymns** and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, &mdash; Ephesians 5:19

While psalms and hymns are specifically mentioned, a third category of praise music is mentioned. In addition to psalms and hymns being present in a true church of God there will also be spiritual songs.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> Let the word of Christ<sup>[a]</sup> dwell in you richly, teaching and exhorting one another with all wisdom, singing **psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs**, all with grace<sup>[b]</sup> in your hearts to God. — Colossians 3:16

I recommend that your church maintain [**psalms**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl4ble8bonI) and [**hymns**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Hlbsp03BE), secondly, spiritual songs are also acceptable if the message is spiritual and Christ centered. Psalms can be old or new, as long as they are Psalms. Hymns can be professional or humble as long as they're hymns.

- St. Augustine and virtually every other church father did not hold to limited atonement.
- Luther & John Calvin did not hold to limited atonement either.
- Jonathan Edwards was likely a hypothetical universalist.

Please refer to my full length article on [Amyraldianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian).

> In sum, regarding the question, For whom did Christ die? we find biblical warrant for dividing the question into God’s purpose regarding the provision of the Atonement and his purpose concerning the application thereof. **Scripture leads us to conclude that God loves all people he created and that Christ died to provide salvation for all.** The provision side of the Atonement is part of the general will of God that must be preached to all. But beyond this, the Father loves the “sheep” with a special love,<sup>117</sup> and in the divine will the Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s death to the “sheep,” or the elect. The application side of the Atonement is part of the special will of God shared with those who come to faith. This conclusion—that Christ died to make atonement for all to the end that its benefits would be applied to the elect—coheres with the perspective of <span style="color:#3EA055;">**Sublapsarian Calvinism** [Moderate Calvinism]</span>. <span style="color:darkred;">**It differs from the Supralapsarian** [Hyper-Calvinism]</span> and <span style="color:#FBB917;">**Infralapsarian schemes** [Scholastic Calvinism]</span>, which teach that Christ died to make provision only for the sins of the elect. And <span style="color:darkblue;">**it differs from the Arminian scheme** [Wesleyan]</span>  of decrees, which states that God willed the application of the Atonement to all, but that the divine purpose was frustrated by human resistance. A.H. Strong reflected the biblical perspective when he wrote, “Not the atonement therefore is limited, but the application through the work of the Holy Spirit.”<sup>118</sup>
>
Thomas J. Nettles designates this development a modification of the limited Atonement hypothesis.119 Millard J. Erickson, reflecting on classical formulations of the ordo salutis, describes the position as a form of the unlimited or universal Atonement thesis.120 The view presented may be neither, as it divides the question into the divine intention concerning the provision of the cross, which is universal, and his intention concerning the application thereof, which is particular. <span style="color:#3EA055;">The position outlined is not Arminianism (as some allege) but a viewpoint close to that of Calvin himself</span>—a position that was narrowed by later, scholastic Calvinism. Our perspective, moreover, offers greater specificity than the dictum frequently articulated in evangelical circles: “The Atonement is sufficient for all but efficient for the elect.” Rather, it affirms that by divine intention Christ’s suffering and death are universal in its provision and particular in its application. 
>
A. Realize That Christ Died for You
>
The multiple purposes of Christ’s death on the cross can be represented by three concentric circles. **The largest circle represents the entire world for whom the Savior died as the adequate provision for sins (1 Tim 4:10; 1 John 2:2; 4:14). The middle circle delineates the sum of all believers, i.e., the church (John 10:11, 15; Acts 20:28; Rom 8:32; Gal 1:4; Eph 5:2), to whom Christ’s saving provisions were actually applied. And the innermost circle represents the individual believer for whom Christ made atonement (Gal 2:20b).** That Christ died for me and for you individually and personally is made clear by Paul’s words in the preceding text: “the Son of God . . . loved me [me] and gave himself for me [hyper emou].” It is highly significant that in describing the true Gospel and its ministry Paul used the first-person, singular pronoun twenty-eight times in this second chapter of Galatians.

The following is an excerpt from Dr. Robert Letham's “Systematic Theology,” Chapter 14. Election and the Counsel of Redemption. Letham unbiasedly describes [Calamy's unique hypothetical universalism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/#letham5.7), of which several exist. 


>
**14.1.7 Hypothetical Universalism**
>
Some English theologians proposed a slightly different argument than Amyraut.<sup>116</sup> Again, the point of disagreement lay more on the intent of the atonement than on election and reprobation. **Edmund Calamy (1600–1666), a member of the Westminster Assembly, held that Christ died absolutely for the elect and conditionally for the reprobate, in case they believe.** In this context, Calamy preserved the congruence in the works of the Trinity and avoided a split between the atonement and the intercession of Christ.<sup>117</sup> Calamy distinguished his position from Arminianism. Arminians say Christ paid a price placing all in an equal state of salvation. Calamy insisted his views “doth neither intrude upon either [the] doctrine of speciall election or speciall grace.” He argued that Arminianism asserted that Christ simply suffered; all people are placed in a potentially salvable situation, so that any who believe will be saved. In contrast, he believed Christ’s death saves his elect and grants a conditional possibility of salvation to the rest.<sup>118</sup> In distinction from Amyraut, Calamy held that the atonement is efficacious for the elect. Calamy’s views were not seen as posing a major threat to the Reformed consensus.

<a name="arminius" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.4.3.3 Remonstrants and Arminians Universal Atonement</a>

> ... **Turning to the issue of the extent or intent of the Atonement, Arminians consistently uphold a universal Atonement; Christ died for the purpose of providing salvation for the entire world.** They appeal to texts stating that Christ died for “all” persons (2 Cor 5:14-15; 1 Tim 2:6; Tit 2:11) or for the“world” (John 1:29; 4:42; 1 John 2:2; 4:14). They note that the word “whosoever” is used more than 110 times in the NT. Since the Gospel is for all, every last person can be saved. Christ’s death, however, is effectual only in those who desire it and who believe. Anticipating later developments, many patristic writers held that Christ died for the sins of the world. Athanasius (d. 373) maintained that in the divine scheme of things “death there had to be, and death for all, so that the due of all might be paid.”26 Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386) affirmed that “Jesus truly suffered for all men.”27
>
Later James Arminius (d. 1609) postulated the provisional universality of the Atonement. He said rather directly, “Christ died for all men and for every individual.”28 Desiring that none should perish in their sins, God bestows prevenient grace universally and extends salvation to all through worldwide Gospel proclamation. A year after Arminius’ death a group of his followers drafted the Five Articles of the Remonstrance (1610), article two of which reads:
>
>> Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, died for all men and for every man, so that he has obtained for them all, by his death on the cross, redemption and the forgiveness of sins; yet that no one actually enjoys this forgiveness of sins except the believer, according to the word of the Gospel of John 3:16: “God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
>
Arminians such as Miley aver that an unlimited Atonement makes universal salvation theoretically possible. But since many persons fail to respond to the Gospel in faith, not everyone is actually saved. Arminians further argue that it would be duplicitous of God to offer salvation to all if, in fact, Christ did not make universal provision on the cross. Only on the basis ofa universal Atonement can the Gospel be sincerely preached to all. Many Arminians envisage universal Atonement as a logical outcome of the governmental theory. Miley typically insisted that a universal Atonement maximally upholds the cause of moral government. The broader the intent of the Atonement, the greater the good that accrues. Miley thus concluded, “The atonement, as a provision of infinite love for a common race in a common ruin of sin, with its unrestricted overture of grace and requirement of a universal Atonement can the Gospel be sincerely preached to all.

Christians undergo a progressive sanctification of decreasing patterns of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Ro 6:1-2,15). While the scriptures teach that a living or saving faith &ldquo;results&rdquo; in obedience to God, it does not teach that it &ldquo;includes&rdquo; obedience, nor does it teach perfectionism. Obedience is only seen as a fruit of genuine saving faith, and only as an evidence not a proof.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> What shall we say then? **Are we to remain in sin** so that grace may increase? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> **Absolutely not!** How can we who died to sin still live in it?

<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> What then? **Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!** &mdash; Romans 6:1-2,15 NET

<!-- <a name="repentance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.2 Repentance Is An Immediate Fruit Of Genuine Saving Faith</a> -->

These verses prove that Christians do not pursue lifestyles of indulgent sin. We are not under the law, we are under grace, yet we still do not make a practice of sinning.

1. We're not under the law (Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. We're under grace (Eph 2:8-10)
3. We still don't make a "practice" of sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31).

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">🧩 Is God’s Foreknowledge Causative?</span>

Even though I'm reformed leaning, I appreciate the clear logic of <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#heiser">Dr. Heiser</a> who provided us with a piece of the puzzle. ***&ldquo;foreknowledge does not necessitate predestination&rdquo;***. He goes on to make a good example by saying the following:

> the fact that God knows possibilities, and all possibilities don't happen. tells you that God's foreknowledge of those possibilities did not result in the predestination of all those possibilities. foreknowledge and predestination are not inextricably linked, **foreknowledge does not necessitate predestination**. God knowing all things real and possible actually undermines that idea. &mdash; <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#heiser">Dr. Michael S. Heiser (PhD, University of Wisconsin)</a>

So right at the get go, we sould not confuse one for the other. *The Golden Chain of Redemption* also demonstrates two seperate concepts. &ldquo;For those whom he **foreknew** he also **predestined**&rdquo;:

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> For those whom he **foreknew** he also **predestined** to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> And those whom he predestined he also **called**, and those whom he called he also **justified**, and those whom he justified he also **glorified**. &mdash; Romans 8:29-30 ESV

For this reason, we will view the topic of foreknowledge and the topic of predestination as individual, but intertwined, sections. God predestined some, not all, of the things in which he foreknew.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">🧩 Demonstrating Foreordination</span>

Propnents of <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen" style="font-weight:bold;">unconditional single election</a> have provided many examples in the bible that demonstrate events which are determined or foreordained.

[Dr. D.A. Carson (PhD, University of Cambridge)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#god-as-sovereign) provides incontrovertible proof of determinism as foreordination in scripture:

> ... Chance is excluded; and if here and there we read of something that might be considered a chance event, it is not really thought of apart from God's direction (1 Sam. 6.9; 20.26; 1 Kgs. 22.34; Ruth 2.3; 2 Chr. 18.33). Hence **the lot is used to discover Yahweh's will, 'and is didactically recognised as under His control' (Prov. 16.33; cf. Josh. 7.16; 14.2; 18.6; 1 Sam. 10.19-21; Jonah 1.7)**.

> ... **Human thoughts and decisions are often attributed directly to God's determining (e.g. 2 Sam. 24.1; Isa. 19.13f.; 37.7; Prov. 21.1; Ezra 1.1; 7.6, 27f.; Neh. 2.11f.).** ...

> Examples are so numerous that only a few instances may be cited. Micaiah's description of the heavenly courts and **the selection of a lying spirit whose success is guaranteed (1 Kgs. 22.19-22; 2 Chr. 18.18-22), the inciting of David to evil purpose (2 Sam. 24.1)**, the selling of Joseph into slavery (Gen. 50.20), **the sending forth of evil spirits to their appointed tasks (e.g. Judg. 9.23ff.; 1 Sam. 16.14; 18.10)**, the prologue of Job, not to mention the specific remarks of the prophets (e.g. Does evil (rā'āh) befall a city, unless the LORD has done it?" Amos 3.6; cf. Isa. 14.24-7; 45.7), all clamour for attention. ...

> ... **God is also said to control the minds of his people for good. Sometimes he is petitioned to do so.** Such expressions are particularly common in the prophets who look forward to the new covenant (cf. Jer. 31.31-4; 32.40; Ezek. 11.19f.; 36.22ff.; Zeph. 3.9-13; etc.), but are certainly not restricted to such a framework (e.g. 1 Chr. 29.17-19).

> Yahweh is holy, sovereign, full of special regard for his elect, and personally ruling in the affairs of men. This view of God makes the perplexity of his people understandable when, from the human perspective, it appears that Yahweh has dealt harshly (Ruth 1.20f.), unfairly (Job 3ff.), or without due consideration of the wickedness of other men (Habbakuk; Ps. 73). It prompts a cry like that in Isaiah 63.17: '**O LORD, why dost thou make us err from thy ways, and harden our heart**, so that we fear thee not? Return for the sake of thy servants, for the tribes of thy heritage. (Cf. also Isa. 64.76.).

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">🧩 Narrowing Down Possible Views</span>

1. If the word proginṓskō means to foreordain as the Calvinists, Amyraldians, and Compatibilists say, and as the lexicons lean, logic shows that it would not be all encompassing or mechanically deterministic. Since foreknowledge as foreordination would not necessitate predestination in every instance. It is always true that God is absolutely sovereign, but it seems that he allows some form of freedom in the system he designed and so a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#carson" style="font-weight:bold;">Moderately Reformed Compatibilist</a> view would be the most precise.
2. If proginṓskō means prescience, then I would say, the best definition put forth would be the <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#smith" style="font-weight:bold;">Reformed Wesleyan Foreknowledge</a> view.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">🧩 Conclusion</span>

<!-- Before concluding any [research](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/) on the topic, I was raised to believe in the <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#smith" style="font-weight:bold;">Wesleyan Foreknowledge</a> view.  -->

Between Heiser, Lennox, & Turek we know that foreknowledge is non-causative. I know the sun will rise tomorrow, have I caused it to happen? No. The culpability of those involved in Christ’s predestined crucifixion should demonstrate this (Acts 2:23 NET). Lennox has also pointed out that foreknowledge of faith is not a work (Ro 4:5). πιστεύω (pisteuō) is the same word used in John 3:16. 

From the other side, Demarest, Rhodes, & Carson have provided evidence of foreordination in the Bible. It would be difficult to say if election is conditional and based upon foreseen faith a kind of prescience, or if it were unconditional sovereign act of forelove/forordination. I do know one thing, the Compatibilists are correct that both God's sovereign choice is in just about everything that happens, as well as human responsibility.

I have to side with <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#carson">D.A. Carson</a> on this; however, I must state again, it is unclear upon what God is basing election. Just because God determines and chooses who will be saved, does not mean he bases it upon nothing. 

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">🧩 Unique Theory & Basis Speculation</span>

I did have a view that sat between Moderate Calvinism ([Amyraldianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/)) and [Reformed Wesleyanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/) and I once called it the &ldquo;*prescient forelove view*&rdquo; or &ldquo;prescientism&rdquo;. 

It was uniquely compatibilist but foreknowledge leaning. It was essentially the wesleyan foreknowledge view with free will stripped out of the reason for the election. It made the philosophical distinction between love and decision. It replaced the arbitrary nature of election for a reciprocated "forelove" not based on cognitive assent and choice making, but on the genuine dispositions of the heart and the fiducial nature of genuine saving faith.

Not "knowledge of facts" but instead a forefelt "foreloving" of reciprocated love irrespective of time. It describes the deeper inexplicable and enigmatic ways of reciprocal love that has always defied logic, reason, facts, choice, will or decision.

A forelove, deep, transcendant, intimate, and reciprocal, beyond the spatiotemporal limitations of human understanding or free decision. Neither by arbitrary or random selection (cal.), nor by facts of forseen free will choice (arm.), but a deeper foreloving by the heart he did foreknow.

- Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ?
- How many of you chose your wives or husbands without reciprocation? None that I know of.
- When has love ever been a pre-planned, scheduled event? Marriage maybe but not love.
- People don't control or decide the way their hearts feel.
- When you're in love, you "just know," it's not about free will or decision.
- This reciprocation was never a logical decision was it.
- We were made in the image of God but both sides are stuck on the brain instead of the heart where it should be (reciprocal love that transcends time).
- What could be more love based than faith (trust and reliance)?
- Faith alone is not a decision (of the mind), it is a disposition (of the heart). Assenting to facts even a demon (James 2:19), or computer can do.
- Notice how we are judged by the secrets of our hearts (Ro 2:16 NET, 1 Sam 16:7 NET; Ps 139:1-2 NLT; Jer 17:10 NLT).
- &ldquo;Free will carried many a soul to hell, but never a soul to heaven.&rdquo; &mdash; Spurgeon

<!-- While I believe that all Protestants have members among the saved within the invisible Church, some of their theologies leave much to be desired: -->

<!-- The only thing that I would alter is that this foreloving is prescient upon it's reciprocity, not in the way of facts of forseen faith, or human free will like in Arminianism, but instead something much more profound. Deeper also, than the one-sided arbitrary choice of Calvinist theology. Not "knowledge of facts" but instead a forefelt "foreloving" of reciprocated love irrespective of time. It describes the deeper inexplicable and enigmatic ways of reciprocal love that has always defied logic, reason, facts, choice, will or decision.

A forelove, deep, transcendant, intimate, and reciprocal, beyond the spatiotemporal limitations of human understanding or free decision. Neither by arbitrary or random selection (cal.), nor by facts of forseen faith (arm.), but a deeper foreloving by the heart he did foreknow.

- Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ?
- How many of you chose your wives or husbands without reciprocation? None that I know of.
- When has love ever been a pre-planned, scheduled event?
- People don't control or decide the way their hearts feel.
- When you're in love, you "just know," it's not about free will or decision.
- This reciprocation was never a logical decision was it.
- How could something heartfelt (primary) be a human decision (secondary).
- We were made in the image of God but both sides are stuck on the brain instead of the heart where it should be (reciprocal love that transcends time).
- What could be more love based than faith (trust and reliance)?
- Foreknowledge is non-causative. I know the sun will rise tomorrow, have I caused it to happen? No. The culpability of those involved in Christ’s predestined crucifixion should demonstrate this (Acts 2:23 NET).
- Foreknowledge of reciprocated love in genuine faith is not a work (Ro 4:5).
- If salvation is by faith only and you don't acknowledge faith as being a part of election, then you're contradicting yourself when you say that we're saved by faith only.
- We're saved by grace through faith (Eph. 2:8-9), so faith must have something to do with the election process, the only thing I'd point out is that it's not the works or actions of a choice or decision, but the heart change and reciprocation.
- Faith alone is not a decision (of the mind), it is a disposition (of the heart). Assenting to facts even a demon (James 2:19), or computer can do.
- Notice how we are judged by the secrets of our hearts (Ro 2:16 NET, 1 Sam 16:7 NET; Ps 139:1-2 NLT; Jer 17:10 NLT).
- &ldquo;Free will carried many a soul to hell, but never a soul to heaven.&rdquo; &mdash; Spurgeon

This is my conclusion. My conclusion seems to have no name, but it does acknowledge predestination (election not reprobation). It also does not require or play upon human free will or choice since that would be works. At the same time it is not an anti-free will theory per se, just that it isn't needed to satisfy the requirements of this scriptual puzzle. While this theory is still under development, I'd like to "marry" this idea with a hypothetical universalist system (Les hypothètiques) or amyraldianism. So in overview: -->

<!-- - 🚫 In [Calvinist theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-calvinist/) there's an arbitrary election of those to receive saving faith. Salvation then, isn't based on faith alone, but by a random or arbitrary selection alone. 
    - Hopefully you win the lottery. Good luck.
- 🚫 In [Arminian theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-arminian/) salvation is prescient upon forseen human faith which is probably correct, but they put too strong an emphasis on human free will and decision so as to make it feel like a work. So then salvation is not by faith alone, but by works and decisions alone. 
    - Hopefully you don't have <a href="#legal">legalistic false assurance</a>.
- 🚫 In modern neotheologies, like extreme forms of the 80s "free grace" movement, salvation is by blind faith (evidenceless) and assent (which is delusional); these teachings flirt with the heresy of [antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/antinomian-heresy/) and twist the meaning of [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).
    - Hopefully you don't have the <a href="#dead">false assurance of a dead or superficial faith</a>. -->

<!-- In my theology salvation is prescient upon reciprocated forelove within the genuine dispositions of the heart and the fiducial nature of genuine saving faith. So then salvation is neither by random selection, nor by human works, but instead salvation is by grace through genuine faith. -->

<!-- - Foreknowledge is non-causative. I know the sun will rise tomorrow, have I caused it to happen? No. The culpability of those involved in Christ’s predestined crucifixion should demonstrate this (Acts 2:23 NET).
- Foreknowledge of reciprocated love in genuine faith is not a work (Ro 4:5). πιστεύω (pisteuō) is the same word used in John 3:16. -->

<!-- - Some do not teach trust and reliance on the person of Christ, these people are likely not saved. -->

<!-- - Moderate forms hold to an evidence-based faith like most rational groups but still butcher [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/). -->

<!-- As far as I can articluate right now, my theology is a hybrid between [Amyraldianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) and [Reformed Wesleyanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/). Two moderate views that better describe the first wave of the reformation and their founders. Here are some additonal thoughts that are **subject to change**: -->

<!-- My slightly altered [Amyraldian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) theology, which you could say is slightly Reformed Wesleyan in it's election view, is still being developed. Here are some additonal thoughts that are **subject to change**: -->

<!-- - It's possible that "before the foundation of the world" (Eph. 1:4), implies, that God's electing "forelove" was prescient upon a hypothetical future not corrupted by total depravity. This would neither interfere with total depravity in our reality nor the need of being rescued by the Sovereign Lord.
- By keeping God's foreknowledge hypothetical upon those who would have reciprocated him had there not been a fall, the position of regeneration could stay the same. -->

<!-- I also believe that my theory works irrespective of human free will. In other words, believe what you want on that, because its not about the head it's about the heart.

- Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ?
- How many of you chose your wives or husbands without reciprocation? None that I know of.
- When has love ever been a pre-planned, scheduled event? Marriage maybe but not love.
- People don't control or decide the way their hearts feel.
- When you're in love, you "just know," it's not about free will or decision.
- This reciprocation was never a logical decision was it.
- We were made in the image of God but both sides are stuck on the brain instead of the heart where it should be (reciprocal love that transcends time).

- &ldquo;Free will carried many a soul to hell, but never a soul to heaven.&rdquo; &mdash; Spurgeon -->

<!-- - ✅ In my theology salvation is prescient upon reciprocated love within genuine saving faith. The heart change and disposition that makes faith genuine (beyond works or choice). So then salvation is neither by random selection nor by human decision, but instead salvation is by faith alone. -->

<!-- The Calvinist can't be saved unless faith is given to him, the Arminian must make the decision, a choice, perform an action; my theology is neither, but focuses directly on the genuine dispositions of the heart like both groups technically do, but without the arbirtary election process, or human workings.

My theory works irrespective of whether there is free will or not, and whether or not God grants faith or not. I am firmly historic Protestant, but moderate in the distinctives. -->

<!-- I believe he does grant faith to the elect, it is simply my understanding of who is elect and how that differs. -->

<!-- This faith then results, but does not include, obedience and good works that follow after one is saved. -->

<!-- is by faith alone and not by random selection or by human working. -->


<!-- It's deeper than arbitrary selection, reciprocation isn't a choice or an action, it's the inexplicable concept of reciprocal forelove.   -->

<!-- If it's not about facts of forseen faith -->

<!-- Is election based upon God's foreknowledge of our faith, or does God grant faith to those whom He elects unconditionally, and arbitrarily, without regard for foreseen human faith? What if the answer was neither? Where is the love in the one-sided arbitrary choice of Calvinist thelogy? Where is the lexicon support for the Arminian election by forseen faith?  -->

<!-- What if instead it was not "knowledge of facts" but instead a forefelt "foreloving" of reciprocated love irrespective of time? This isn't based on anything intellectual so it should dodge the litmus test of the Calvinists, and it should also satisfy the Arminians since its only a slight alteration from facts of faith to the deeper more emotional and intimate hypothetical reciprocation of Love that has always defied logic, reason, and facts. -->

<!-- It is the heart and not the mind. What could be more relational than faith (trust & reliance)? -->

<!-- If this is the case, one could imagine that, this foreloving being reciprocated, not by what we do or by facts known, but by that deeper more profound connection to God that exists irrespective of time or fact based knowledge. A knowing deep down and trancendent beyond knowing with the mind, upon which he elects. This is my theory. -->

<!-- How many of you chose your wives without reciprocation? It's deeper than arbitrary selection, reciprocation isn't a choice or an action, it's the inexplicable concept of reciprocal forelove.  -->

<!-- Perhaps God grants faith to whom he would have forlove with. Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ? -->

<!-- It can't be arminianism, because it's not based on forseen faith (facts of), nor works or anything like that. It's forknew relationally and reciprocally without facts of forseen faith. -->

<!-- Agape is nice, but agape returned is better. -->

<!-- If I could push my theory further, one could surmise something more amyraldian mixed with a touch of weslyanism. -->

<!-- <a name="predestination" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 Predestination & Determinism</a> -->

<!-- - <a name="election" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 Effectual calling</a>

    The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.

3. **Belief in the Gospel**
    - Quickened by the Spirit, the minds of the elect are persuaded of the truths of the Gospel of God’s grace.
4. **Repentance**
    - Likewise enabled by the Spirit the effectually called despise and turn away from all known sins.
5. **Trust in Christ**
    - The effectually called personally commit themselves to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their life.
6. **Regeneration**
    - God creates in justified believers new life, defined as the radical reorientation of the dispositions and affections toward God.
7. **Union with Christ**
    - The Spirit unites newly born saints with Jesus Christ in a vital, spiritual, and indissoluble union. The NT describes this experiential reality by the familiar “in Christ” motif.
8. **Justification**
    - God in turn reckons believing sinners righteous in his sight and bestows upon them the gift of eternal life.
9. **Sanctification**
    - By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.
10. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - By the application of divine power, God faithfully preserves regenerate saints in faith and hope unto the attainment of eternal life.
11. **Glorification**
    - God perfects the final and complete redemption of the believer—body, soul, and spirit—at the Parousia of the Lord Jesus Christ.  -->
