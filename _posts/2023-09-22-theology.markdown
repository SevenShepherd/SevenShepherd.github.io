<a name="alone" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">üö∂üìú 1. The 80's version of the Gospel DOES NOT teach the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith alone</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement **does not teach the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith alone**, because it holds a historically unusual view that is based on a misunderstanding of *alone* in the historic Protestant insistence on "justification by faith alone."

> Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10). &mdash; True Definition Of Faith Alone

‚ö†Ô∏è The full definition that correctly concludes, &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen">but the faith that justifies is never alone</span>*&rdquo; was <span style="color:FireBrick">mysteriously removed by the 80s version of the gospel</span>. Faith Alone *&ldquo;resulting&rdquo;* in obedience to God and good works that *&ldquo;follow after&rdquo;* justification was taught for hundreds of years. [Protestant leaders throughout history have consistently defined faith alone as resulting in obedience.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/) I think it should be obvious, that if someone were to tamper with the reformation doctrine of "faith alone," that it would destabilize the soundness of the doctrine.

<!-- The second half of &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***&rdquo; protects us from [**the heresy of antinomianism**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism) (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62). While the first half protects us from legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28). -->

The second half of &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***&rdquo; protects us from [**the heresy of antinomianism**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism).<sup>2</sup> While the first half protects us from legalism.<sup>1</sup>

1. Verses against legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. Verses against antinomianism (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62)
3. Verses for obedience &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; salvation (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10)
4. Verses for Godly dispositions of Love (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35)
5. Verses for Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; Gal 5:22-23)
6. Verses for good works &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; salvation (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)

‚ùå 80's teachers will attempt to convince you that the statement, &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone*&rdquo; is contradictory, politely inform them that they are mistaken, and that both logic and English grammar disagree with their assessment. Then explain the following to them politely:

‚úîÔ∏è There are two different verbs in the two halves of the sentence, which makes it clear that &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; in the first half of the expression is functioning in a different way from &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; in the second half. In the first half &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; modifies &ldquo;*justified,*&rdquo; and in the second half it modifies &ldquo;*is.*&rdquo;

The 80's version of the Gospel diminishes sound doctrine (2Tim 4:3-4 NLT) and is possibly leading hundreds of innocent men, women, and children into debauched lifestyles (2Pe 2:1-2 NET) and [antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism). We need to combat this by maintaining the true definition of faith alone. 

<!-- You can also read about how [**Protestant leaders throughout history have consistently defined faith alone as resulting in obedience**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). -->

Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). This has been the teaching of [**Historic Christianity**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/historical-christianity/) for hundreds of years. It is not legalistic. Necessarily follows is not meritoriously contributes.

<a name="repent" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">üö∂üìú 2. Does The 80's version of the Gospel teach against Christ's repentance?</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement weakens the gospel message by avoiding any call to unbelievers to repent of their sins. The result is that some followers of *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* teaching have never repented of their sins, and may not be saved. We do not repent to merit or earn our salvation, we repent because our faith is genuine and we have not made a false profession of faith (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4), we repent because our love for God is not superficial (Jn 14:15,21).

> Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">proclaiming the gospel of God</span>, and saying, ‚ÄúThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkRed;">repent</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">and</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkRed;">believe</span> in the gospel.‚Äù &mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Jesus</span> in Mark 1:14-15 ESV preaching and proclaiming that repentance is part of the gospel.

Anyone who can read English can verify that *repentance* does not simply mean a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; All one has to do is inspect [the world's most authoritative Greek lexicons](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) to find that the true meaning of [metano√©≈ç](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [met√°noia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) falls under the second meaning of &ldquo;*feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense)*&rdquo; as taught by Christ & The Apostles.

> Many understand *repentance* to mean simply a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; The weakness of this position is that, for the New Testament, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">this meaning finds no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation</span>, none of which translate metano√©≈ç and met√°noia as &ldquo;*change of mind*&rdquo; for New Testament passages. <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">It is a definition unique to Free Grace supporters</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference works</span>.

### Repentance

[**The true meaning of repentance**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ. Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith. 

> Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

- Not justifying (Rom 3:28; Eph 2:8-10).
- Imperfect (1Jn 1:8‚Äì10; 2:1-2).
- **Taught alongside faith by Christ Himself** (Mark 1:14-15).
- One of the reasons Jesus came (Lk 5:32).
- Taught as [**an inward resolve to turn from sin**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
- **An immediate fruit** of genuine saving faith resulting in good works and righteous behavior (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5).
- **Will happen** in genuine believers (1Jn 3:6-10). logically (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
- **Commanded** by God (Ac 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- **Granted** by God (Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25).
- Growth **given** by God (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4).
- Preached **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Produced from Godly sorrow (2 Cor. 7:10; Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- **Leading to salvation** and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Described as **needed** and necessary (Lk 15:7).
- Repent or Perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Unrepentant sin not tolerated and not a one time event (Lk 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:11-13).

<a name="assurance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">üö∂üìú 3. Is The 80's version of the Gospel departing from scripture, indoctrinating innocent children into lifestyles of sin and false assurance?</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement gives false assurance of eternal life to many people who profess faith in Christ but then show no evidence in their pattern of life or even in continuing to say that they believe in Christ. The result is that many people have been assured that they are saved, but they are not.

> Do not be deceived, if you are walking after the flesh and involved in the things of the flesh, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you have no assurance of being in the Kingdom of Heaven</span> &mdash; [**Chuck Smith (YouTube Short)**](https://youtube.com/shorts/aBG9kH-z8Q8?si=_jqYQqF6bgbN9TZZ)

It will help you to make the distinction between **(1)** justification, which is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and **(2)** assurance of salvation, which is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT; Jn 14:15,21). &ldquo;*we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.*... *That is how we know we are living in him.*&rdquo;<sup style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/">‚Ä†</a></sup>

> **Biblical faith is evidence-based.**... **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing.... &mdash; [Dr. John C. Lennox (DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; PhD, University of Cambridge; DSc, Cardiff University)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#lennox)

<a name="trust" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">üö∂üìú 4. Does The 80's version of the Gospel teach against Christ's *&ldquo;trustful belief&rdquo;* by falsely teaching *&ldquo;assent to facts&rdquo;* as salvific?</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement leads its supporters to overemphasize one necessary component of genuine faith (mental assent to the Bible's propositions about Christ's atoning work) and to underemphasize another necessary component of genuine faith (namely, heartfelt trust in the living person of Jesus Christ as my Savior and my God). The result is that some followers of the Free Grace movement intellectually agree with the right doctrines, but they have never trusted in Christ as a person, and they are not truly saved.

‚ùå Misguided teachers teach **against** Christ and the lexicon definition of &ldquo;*believe*,&rdquo; by attempting to teach &ldquo;*assent to facts*&rdquo; as salvific, which the Apostle James was clearly against (James 2:19).

‚úîÔ∏è Christ taught &ldquo;*trustful belief*&rdquo; ([pisteu≈ç](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#salvific)) as salvific: (Jn 3:16; 11:25-26). True teaching emphasizes heartfelt trust in the person of Christ, whereas false teaching overemphasizes agreement with facts. We can verify this by inspecting the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicons and dictionaries.

> **2 to entrust oneself to an entity in complete confidence, believe (in), trust,** w. implication of total commitment to the one who is trusted. In our lit. God and Christ are objects of this type of faith that relies on their power and nearness to help, in addition to being convinced that their revelations or disclosures are true. &mdash; Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (**BDAG**), **the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon**

> 4\. piste√∫≈ç means **&ldquo;to trust&rdquo; (also &ldquo;to obey&rdquo;)**, &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; (words), and in the passive &ldquo;to enjoy confidence&rdquo; (cf. the later sense &ldquo;to confide in&rdquo;). &mdash; The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (**TDNT "Kittel"**)

<a name="unlikely" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">üö∂üìú 5. The 80's version of the Gospel promotes numerous highly unusual, highly unlikely interpretations of Scripture</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement promotes numerous highly unusual, highly unlikely interpretations of the New Testament because of their need to defend a mistaken understanding of the word alone in the phrase "faith alone." They use this misunderstanding to diminish Christ's call to repentance and His fruit-bearing metaphor. Below you will see proof that scripture goes against the 80's movement.

- [üí¨ ‚ÄúThe times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent‚Äù ‚Äï The Apostle Paul (where there is genuine faith, there is always an inward resolve to turn from sin)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/acts-17-30/)
    - Acts 17 is the Apostle Paul's initial gospel proclamation to the philosophers in Athens. The one and only thing he says that God commands is that they repent from sin (feel remorse, repent, be converted in a religio-ethical sense). Repentance in Paul's preaching is necessary to escape final judgement (See Ac 17:31). This is why it's best to view repentance as a fruit of genuine saving faith, this protects us from legalism and upholds scripture simultaneously.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Under construction - I will update this with examples in time. You could refresh the page in a week or every so often. I will likely make a list of links to future articles here, that expand upon these bad interpretations.

<a name="fruit" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">üö∂üìú 6. Does The 80's version of the Gospel teach against Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor and against the warnings of the Apostles?</a>

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: there are some moderates within the 80s group that do teach correctly on fruit-bearing, namely, [Charles Ryrie](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#ryrie), see link; however, there is an extremist faction within the 80sFG that is reminiscent of the hyper-grace [antinomians](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism). This section addresses these extremists.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

<!-- becoming reminiscent of false teachers -->

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, is not true faith. It is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26).

Because I already addressed [the heresy of antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism) multiple times, I'm going to briefly cover the topic here:

1. **The Apostle Peter** reveals that false teachers would infiltrate the church, lead many into [debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles, slandering the way of truth with their destructive heresies. In 2 Peter 2 he describes them as, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed&rdquo;*</span> (v. 12), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;springs without water and mists driven by a storm&rdquo;*</span> (v. 17), and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;slaves of depravity&rdquo;*</span> (v. 19). These statements showcase that the subjects were unregenerate professors of the faith. See [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET).
2. **The Apostle John** completely obliterates the extremist 80's version of the Gospel 1 Jn 2:3-6 when he says, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.&rdquo;*</span> He later states, in 1 John 3:7-9, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Little children, let no one deceive you. ... Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, ... No one born of God makes a practice of sinning ...&rdquo;*</span> proving, without a shadow of a doubt, that a true born again has undergone regeneration by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. They no longer &ldquo;*practice*&rdquo; and pursue lifestyles of sin.

When confronted with the view that I now advocate, I was skeptical. However, I have always considered Acts 17:11 to be a vitally important attitude to have: ‚ÄúThese were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.‚Äù After following that admonition, I changed my thinking about repentance &mdash; [Dr. Bob Wilikin, Does Your Mind Need Changing?

<a name="conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">üö∂üìú 9. Summary & Conclusions</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement diminishes scripture and, in my experience, has lead them to believe terribly destructive things about their walk with Christ. It saddens me greatly to see this happening. Because of these concerns, I cannot recommend 80s *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* version of the gospel, or the 80s *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement, as a legitimate option for evangelicals to accept and follow.

> ‚ÄúThe so-called Free Grace version of the gospel of Jesus Christ is unbiblical, anti-evangelical, and sub-Christian, ...‚Äù ‚Äî J.I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford) Time magazine top 25 evangelical.

I recommend moderate forms of Protestantism instead, like, [Amyraldism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/), the [original Calvary Chapel distinctive](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/calvary-chapel/), or [Reformed Wesleyanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/) where there is safety in scripture, the academic community, and centuries of sound doctrine.

<!-- If you find yourself lost in this 80's movement, I would urge you to leave it for safe moderate forms of protestantism instead, like, [Amyraldism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/), the [original Calvary Chapel distinctive](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/calvary-chapel/), or [Reformed Wesleyanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/) where there is safety in scripture, the academic community, and centuries of sound doctrine. -->

<!-- A Summary of why the 80s version of the gospel is harmful to Christianity

The New Testament clearly and repeatedly teaches the following two points, which differ with the heart of the 80s Free Grace Gospel:

1) Repentance from sin (in the sense of remorse for sin (2 Cor. 7:10) and an internal resolve to forsake it) is necessary for saving faith,

and

2) Saving faith ‚Äúresults‚Äù in (not ‚Äúincludes‚Äù) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that ‚Äúfollow after‚Äù (not ‚Äúmerits‚Äù) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).

These two points are entirely consistent with the great Reformation teaching that "we are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone." 

The mistakes of the Free Grace movement today all stem from a misunderstanding of the way the word alone is used in the expression "justification by faith alone."

My concerns are organized into five points, covering one historical concern and four practical concerns, as follows. -->

**Sin is any failure to conform to the moral law of God in act, attitude, or nature.** It is defined in relation to God and his moral law. Scripturally, it is defined in relationship to God‚Äôs law and his moral character. John tells us that ‚Äúsin is lawlessness‚Äù (1 John 3:4; Mt 7:23).

There are at least three types of sin: inherited sin (Psalm 51:5), imputed sin (Romans 5:18), and personal sin.

The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

> The call to repent was the first and fundamental summons in the preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2), Jesus (Matt. 4:17), the Twelve (Mark 6:12), Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:38), Paul to the Gentiles (Acts 17:30; 26:20), and the glorified Christ to five of the seven churches in Asia (Rev. 2:5, 16, 22; 3:3, 19).

>&mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (PhD, University of Oxford), Concise Theology. 60. Repentance: A Christian Changes Radically. On [faith](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo), on [repentance](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8).

The Bible teaches that we should repent, turn away from our sin, and put our trust in the person of Christ Jesus. He has paid for our redemption with His blood, He is deserving of your trust (Jn 3:16), He is worthy of your love (Jn 14:15,21). Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ.

> The gospel can be summarized in different ways. Sometimes faith alone is named as the one thing necessary for salvation (see John 3:16; Acts 16:31; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 2:8‚Äì9), other times repentance alone is named (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10), and sometimes both are named (Acts 20:21). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Genuine faith always involves repentance</span>, and vice versa. &mdash; ESV Study Bible (Excerpt from Acts 2:38)

Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10). Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).

The open demonstration of this turning to God is sometimes **called conversion** (Acts 15:3; cf. 26:17-18; 1 Thess 1:9-10). Jesus and New Testament preachers commanded people to repent, because **without repentance there can be no salvation** (Matt 3:2; 4:17; Mark 6:12; Luke 5:32; 13:3; 24:47; Acts 2:38; 11:18; 17:30).

It is not a faith that leads to salvation. Faith means complete trust in Jesus Christ and his atoning death. It means that a person has total dependance on Christ for his entire salvation (see FAITH). But such trust is impossible so long as a person still clings to anything of himself. He cannot rely upon the work of Christ for the forgiveness of sin unless he turns from that sin (Mark 1:15; Acts 11:21; 20:21; 26:18; 1 Thess 1:9).

But the preaching of repentance to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:46-47).

<a name="conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em">üîì 6. Conclusion</a>

All sin has been crucified on the cross of Christ Jesus, and [**faith is the instrument by which we lay hold of grace**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-instrument/). In Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior *‚Äúwe have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace‚Äù* (Ephesians 1:7).

- The Bible is against the heresy of legalism, but supports Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor of resulting obedience to God.
    - Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
    - True Christians love God by obeying him (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
    - Faith is not a work (Romans 4:5), and repentance is a fruit (Mt 3:8-10 NLT).
- Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith.
    - Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
    - Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
    - The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- The Bible is against the heresy of antinomianism.
    - We are set free from sin, but not set free to sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).
    - We are no longer under the law (Ro 6:1-2,14-15; Gal 3:23-25; Gal 5:18; Col 2:14), but we still uphold the law (Romans 3:31).
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (**Mt 10:38 NLT**; Mt 16:24; **Lk 9:23** Lk 9:62; **Lk 14:27**; Mk 8:34... Jn 15:8 ESV; Mt 3:10; 25:30).

<!-- Imagine discarding morality and having the audacity to call yourself a follower of Christ -->


<!-- - Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17; 1Jn 2:4).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5)

- The practice of unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (1 Cor. 5:12-13; Luke 17:3-4)
- Those who practice lifelong habitual sin are likely self-deceived (James 1:22; 2 Pe 2:21-22) and will not inherit the kingdom of God (Mt 18:3; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5 ... + Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32)
- True Christians love other believers (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10,14; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
- The Bible teaches us to live Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; 2 Pe 2:21-22).
- The teaching of obedience to God after justification is not burdensome, in fact it's a reason for joy (1 Jn 5:3-4; Jn 15:10-11). -->

<!-- [**Repent**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Lk 13:3; Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4), turn to Christ (Ac 3:19; 26:20), put your trust in Him for justification (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and know that no one born of God practices or pursues lifestyles of sin, habitually or continually (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62). If your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), and you truly abide in Christ, you will bear fruit (Jn 15:1-17), you will not practice these things. -->

<a name="praise" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">üéº 2.5 Praise Music According To Scripture</a>

Some of my earliest memories with Christian praise music is with my Dad, and also, on a separate occasion, standing next to my Grandfather in the church pews while the choir sang beautiful psalms and hymns to the Lord. As time progresses the church seems to fall further and further away from the heartfelt praise music that **the Bible specifically tells us will be in churches**.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> addressing one another in **psalms and hymns** and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, &mdash; Ephesians 5:19

While psalms and hymns are specifically mentioned, a third category of praise music is mentioned. In addition to psalms and hymns being present in a true church of God there will also be spiritual songs.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> Let the word of Christ<sup>[a]</sup> dwell in you richly, teaching and exhorting one another with all wisdom, singing **psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs**, all with grace<sup>[b]</sup> in your hearts to God. ‚Äî Colossians 3:16

I recommend that your church maintain [**psalms**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl4ble8bonI) and [**hymns**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Hlbsp03BE), secondly, spiritual songs are also acceptable if the message is spiritual and Christ centered. Psalms can be old or new, as long as they are Psalms. Hymns can be professional or humble as long as they're hymns.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">üß© The Meaning Can Be Either</span>

The [Lexicon & Dictionary](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#appendix) definitions of progin·πìsk≈ç do seem to favor the Calvinist interpretation; however, <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#demarest">Dr. Demarest</a> demonstrates that the verb could mean either prescience or foreordaining.

> ... &ldquo;With God as subject **the verb could mean either prescience or foreloving/foreordaining** (Rom 8:29; 11:2; 1 Pet 1:20)...

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">üß© Is God‚Äôs Foreknowledge Causative?</span>

Even though I'm reformed leaning, I appreciate the clear logic of <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#heiser">Dr. Heiser</a> who provided us with a piece of the puzzle. ***&ldquo;foreknowledge does not necessitate predestination&rdquo;***. He goes on to make a good example by saying the following:

> the fact that God knows possibilities, and all possibilities don't happen. tells you that God's foreknowledge of those possibilities did not result in the predestination of all those possibilities. foreknowledge and predestination are not inextricably linked, **foreknowledge does not necessitate predestination**. God knowing all things real and possible actually undermines that idea. &mdash; <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#heiser">Dr. Michael S. Heiser (PhD, University of Wisconsin)</a>

So right at the get go, we should not confuse one for the other. *The Golden Chain of Redemption* also demonstrates two seperate concepts. &ldquo;For those whom he **foreknew** he also **predestined**&rdquo;:

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> For those whom he **foreknew** he also **predestined** to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> And those whom he predestined he also **called**, and those whom he called he also **justified**, and those whom he justified he also **glorified**. &mdash; Romans 8:29-30 ESV

For this reason, we will view the topic of foreknowledge and the topic of predestination as individual, but intertwined, sections. God predestined some, not all, of the things in which he foreknew.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">üß© Demonstrating Foreordination</span>

Proponents of <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen" style="font-weight:bold;">unconditional single election</a> have provided many examples in the bible that demonstrate events which are determined or foreordained.

<!-- If could be demonstrated, that determinism is in the Bible, in any way, shape, or form, then the <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#carson" style="font-weight:bold;">Compatibilist</a> would be more likely, but if it were point 2, then the view would have to be a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#smith" style="font-weight:bold;">Reformed Wesleyan</a> view, where God's sovereign choice is given precedence over our free will, even if we have free will. These two stances are like two different compatibilist views, one unconditional and the other conditioned upon foreseen faith. -->

> [@2:58](https://youtu.be/pTuY7ZZ_6jk?si=T6cof83GXHWDgKBB&t=178) ... Arminians will come in and say that God's predetermination or election is based on his foreknowledge in other words God looks down through the corridors of time and decides who's going to respond positively to the gospel and then he will elect those individuals to salvation **the problem with that view is that the Bible doesn't indicate that God just knows things in advance but he actually determines things in advance he determines what will happen** ... &mdash; [Dr. Ron Rhodes (Th.D., Dallas Theological Seminary)](https://youtu.be/pTuY7ZZ_6jk?si=T6cof83GXHWDgKBB&t=178)

[Dr. D.A. Carson (PhD, University of Cambridge)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#god-as-sovereign) provides incontrovertible proof of God's sovereign determining:

> ... Chance is excluded; and if here and there we read of something that might be considered a chance event, it is not really thought of apart from God's direction (1 Sam. 6.9; 20.26; 1 Kgs. 22.34; Ruth 2.3; 2 Chr. 18.33). Hence **the lot is used to discover Yahweh's will, 'and is didactically recognised as under His control' (Prov. 16.33; cf. Josh. 7.16; 14.2; 18.6; 1 Sam. 10.19-21; Jonah 1.7)**.

> ... **Human thoughts and decisions are often attributed directly to God's determining (e.g. 2 Sam. 24.1; Isa. 19.13f.; 37.7; Prov. 21.1; Ezra 1.1; 7.6, 27f.; Neh. 2.11f.).** ...

> Examples are so numerous that only a few instances may be cited. Micaiah's description of the heavenly courts and **the selection of a lying spirit whose success is guaranteed (1 Kgs. 22.19-22; 2 Chr. 18.18-22), the inciting of David to evil purpose (2 Sam. 24.1)**, the selling of Joseph into slavery (Gen. 50.20), **the sending forth of evil spirits to their appointed tasks (e.g. Judg. 9.23ff.; 1 Sam. 16.14; 18.10)**, the prologue of Job, not to mention the specific remarks of the prophets (e.g. Does evil (rƒÅ'ƒÅh) befall a city, unless the LORD has done it?" Amos 3.6; cf. Isa. 14.24-7; 45.7), all clamour for attention. ...

> ... **God is also said to control the minds of his people for good. Sometimes he is petitioned to do so.** Such expressions are particularly common in the prophets who look forward to the new covenant (cf. Jer. 31.31-4; 32.40; Ezek. 11.19f.; 36.22ff.; Zeph. 3.9-13; etc.), but are certainly not restricted to such a framework (e.g. 1 Chr. 29.17-19).

> Yahweh is holy, sovereign, full of special regard for his elect, and personally ruling in the affairs of men. This view of God makes the perplexity of his people understandable when, from the human perspective, it appears that Yahweh has dealt harshly (Ruth 1.20f.), unfairly (Job 3ff.), or without due consideration of the wickedness of other men (Habbakuk; Ps. 73). It prompts a cry like that in Isaiah 63.17: '**O LORD, why dost thou make us err from thy ways, and harden our heart**, so that we fear thee not? Return for the sake of thy servants, for the tribes of thy heritage. (Cf. also Isa. 64.76.).

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">üß© Narrowing Down Possible Views</span>

1. If the word progin·πìsk≈ç means to foreordain as the Calvinists, Amyraldians, and Compatibilists say, and as the lexicons lean... and since foreknowledge as foreordination would not necessitate predestination in every instance. It would seem that he allows some form of freedom in the system he designed and so a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#carson" style="font-weight:bold;">Moderately Reformed Compatibilist</a> view would be the most precise.
2. If progin·πìsk≈ç means prescience, then I would say, the best definition put forth would be the <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#smith" style="font-weight:bold;">Reformed Wesleyan Foreknowledge</a> view.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">‚åõ My Old But Unique Theory</span>

I did have a view that sat between [Amyraldianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) and [Reformed Wesleyanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/) and I once called it the &ldquo;*prescient forelove view*&rdquo; or &ldquo;prescientism&rdquo;. 

It was uniquely compatibilist but foreknowledge leaning. It was essentially the wesleyan foreknowledge view with free will stripped out of the reason for the election. It made the philosophical distinction between faith and decision. It replaced the arbitrary nature of election for a reciprocated "forelove" not based on cognitive assent and choice making, but on the genuine dispositions of the heart and the fiducial nature of genuine saving faith.

Not "knowledge of facts" but instead a forefelt "foreloving" of reciprocated love irrespective of time. It describes the deeper inexplicable and enigmatic ways of reciprocal love that has always defied logic, reason, facts, choice, will or decision.

A forelove, deep, transcendant, intimate, and reciprocal, beyond the spatiotemporal limitations of human understanding or free decision. Neither by arbitrary or random selection (cal.), nor by facts of foreseen free will choice (arm.), but a deeper foreloving by the heart he did foreknow.

- Faith alone is not a decision (of the mind), it is a disposition (of the heart). Assenting to facts even a demon (James 2:19), or computer can do.
- Notice how we are judged by the secrets of our hearts (Ro 2:16 NET, 1 Sam 16:7 NET; Ps 139:1-2 NLT; Jer 17:10 NLT).
- &ldquo;Free will carried many a soul to hell, but never a soul to heaven.&rdquo; &mdash; Spurgeon

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">üß© Conclusion</span>

<!-- Before concluding any [research](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/) on the topic, I was raised to believe in the <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#smith" style="font-weight:bold;">Wesleyan Foreknowledge</a> view.  -->

Between Heiser, Lennox, & Turek we know that foreknowledge is not always causative. I know the sun will rise tomorrow, have I caused it to happen? No. The culpability of those involved in Christ‚Äôs predestined crucifixion should demonstrate this (Acts 2:23 NET). Lennox has also pointed out that foreknowledge of faith is not a work (Ro 4:5). œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœçœâ (pisteu≈ç) is the same word used in John 3:16. 

From the other side, Demarest, Rhodes, & Carson have provided evidence of foreordination in the Bible. It would be difficult to say if election is conditional and based upon foreseen faith as a kind of prescience, or if it were unconditional sovereign act of forelove/foreordination. I do know one thing, the Compatibilists are correct that both God's sovereign choice is in everything that happens, as well as human responsibility existing simultaneously.

I have to side with <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#carson">D.A. Carson</a> on this; however, I must state again, it is unclear upon what God is basing election. Just because God determines and chooses who will be saved, does not mean he bases it upon nothing. If we do have free will it is extraordinarily limited. Think about the following:

- You didn't choose to exist did you? Who consulted you on that?
- You didn't choose your birth place, relatives, genetics, or attitudes.
- If I asked you to sprout wings and fly to the moon you would be unable because you do not have total freedom to do as you will.
- If you truly believe in libertarian free will, you'd believe you could renounce your faith and forfeit salvation. That means no more eternal security.

> ... that's the sovereignty of God hallelujah **but what about my free will, well it's not as free as you think it is, you are free to make choices but you are not free to enforce all of them** ... there is freedom but it's quite limited. In lots of respects, you have not chosen me I've chosen you means that God had the last word ...&mdash; [Dr. Walter Martin (PhD, University of California Coast)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/#martin)

<!-- While I believe that all Protestants have members among the saved within the invisible Church, some of their theologies leave much to be desired: -->

<!-- The only thing that I would alter is that this foreloving is prescient upon it's reciprocity, not in the way of facts of forseen faith, or human free will like in Arminianism, but instead something much more profound. Deeper also, than the one-sided arbitrary choice of Calvinist theology. Not "knowledge of facts" but instead a forefelt "foreloving" of reciprocated love irrespective of time. It describes the deeper inexplicable and enigmatic ways of reciprocal love that has always defied logic, reason, facts, choice, will or decision.

A forelove, deep, transcendant, intimate, and reciprocal, beyond the spatiotemporal limitations of human understanding or free decision. Neither by arbitrary or random selection (cal.), nor by facts of forseen faith (arm.), but a deeper foreloving by the heart he did foreknow.

- Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ?
- How many of you chose your wives or husbands without reciprocation? None that I know of.
- When has love ever been a pre-planned, scheduled event?
- People don't control or decide the way their hearts feel.
- When you're in love, you "just know," it's not about free will or decision.
- This reciprocation was never a logical decision was it.
- How could something heartfelt (primary) be a human decision (secondary).
- We were made in the image of God but both sides are stuck on the brain instead of the heart where it should be (reciprocal love that transcends time).
- What could be more love based than faith (trust and reliance)?
- Foreknowledge is non-causative. I know the sun will rise tomorrow, have I caused it to happen? No. The culpability of those involved in Christ‚Äôs predestined crucifixion should demonstrate this (Acts 2:23 NET).
- Foreknowledge of reciprocated love in genuine faith is not a work (Ro 4:5).
- If salvation is by faith only and you don't acknowledge faith as being a part of election, then you're contradicting yourself when you say that we're saved by faith only.
- We're saved by grace through faith (Eph. 2:8-9), so faith must have something to do with the election process, the only thing I'd point out is that it's not the works or actions of a choice or decision, but the heart change and reciprocation.
- Faith alone is not a decision (of the mind), it is a disposition (of the heart). Assenting to facts even a demon (James 2:19), or computer can do.
- Notice how we are judged by the secrets of our hearts (Ro 2:16 NET, 1 Sam 16:7 NET; Ps 139:1-2 NLT; Jer 17:10 NLT).
- &ldquo;Free will carried many a soul to hell, but never a soul to heaven.&rdquo; &mdash; Spurgeon

This is my conclusion. My conclusion seems to have no name, but it does acknowledge predestination (election not reprobation). It also does not require or play upon human free will or choice since that would be works. At the same time it is not an anti-free will theory per se, just that it isn't needed to satisfy the requirements of this scriptual puzzle. While this theory is still under development, I'd like to "marry" this idea with a hypothetical universalist system (Les hypoth√®tiques) or amyraldianism. So in overview: -->

<!-- - üö´ In [Calvinist theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-calvinist/) there's an arbitrary election of those to receive saving faith. Salvation then, isn't based on faith alone, but by a random or arbitrary selection alone. 
    - Hopefully you win the lottery. Good luck.
- üö´ In [Arminian theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-arminian/) salvation is prescient upon forseen human faith which is probably correct, but they put too strong an emphasis on human free will and decision so as to make it feel like a work. So then salvation is not by faith alone, but by works and decisions alone. 
    - Hopefully you don't have <a href="#legal">legalistic false assurance</a>.
- üö´ In modern neotheologies, like extreme forms of the 80s "free grace" movement, salvation is by blind faith (evidenceless) and assent (which is delusional); these teachings flirt with the heresy of [antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/antinomian-heresy/) and twist the meaning of [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).
    - Hopefully you don't have the <a href="#dead">false assurance of a dead or superficial faith</a>. -->

<!-- In my theology salvation is prescient upon reciprocated forelove within the genuine dispositions of the heart and the fiducial nature of genuine saving faith. So then salvation is neither by random selection, nor by human works, but instead salvation is by grace through genuine faith. -->

<!-- - Foreknowledge is non-causative. I know the sun will rise tomorrow, have I caused it to happen? No. The culpability of those involved in Christ‚Äôs predestined crucifixion should demonstrate this (Acts 2:23 NET).

<!-- - Some do not teach trust and reliance on the person of Christ, these people are likely not saved. -->

<!-- - Moderate forms hold to an evidence-based faith like most rational groups but still butcher [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/). -->

<!-- As far as I can articluate right now, my theology is a hybrid between [Amyraldianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) and [Reformed Wesleyanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/). Two moderate views that better describe the first wave of the reformation and their founders. Here are some additonal thoughts that are **subject to change**: -->

<!-- My slightly altered [Amyraldian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) theology, which you could say is slightly Reformed Wesleyan in it's election view, is still being developed. Here are some additonal thoughts that are **subject to change**: -->

<!-- - It's possible that "before the foundation of the world" (Eph. 1:4), implies, that God's electing "forelove" was prescient upon a hypothetical future not corrupted by total depravity. This would neither interfere with total depravity in our reality nor the need of being rescued by the Sovereign Lord.
- By keeping God's foreknowledge hypothetical upon those who would have reciprocated him had there not been a fall, the position of regeneration could stay the same. -->

<!-- I also believe that my theory works irrespective of human free will. In other words, believe what you want on that, because its not about the head it's about the heart.

- Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ?
- How many of you chose your wives or husbands without reciprocation? None that I know of.
- When has love ever been a pre-planned, scheduled event? Marriage maybe but not love.
- People don't control or decide the way their hearts feel.
- When you're in love, you "just know," it's not about free will or decision.
- This reciprocation was never a logical decision was it.
- We were made in the image of God but both sides are stuck on the brain instead of the heart where it should be (reciprocal love that transcends time).
- What could be more love based than faith (trust and reliance)?
- Faith alone is not a decision (of the mind), it is a disposition (of the heart). Assenting to facts even a demon (James 2:19), or computer can do.
- Notice how we are judged by the secrets of our hearts (Ro 2:16 NET, 1 Sam 16:7 NET; Ps 139:1-2 NLT; Jer 17:10 NLT).
- &ldquo;Free will carried many a soul to hell, but never a soul to heaven.&rdquo; &mdash; Spurgeon -->

<!-- - ‚úÖ In my theology salvation is prescient upon reciprocated love within genuine saving faith. The heart change and disposition that makes faith genuine (beyond works or choice). So then salvation is neither by random selection nor by human decision, but instead salvation is by faith alone. -->

<!-- The Calvinist can't be saved unless faith is given to him, the Arminian must make the decision, a choice, perform an action; my theology is neither, but focuses directly on the genuine dispositions of the heart like both groups technically do, but without the arbirtary election process, or human workings.

My theory works irrespective of whether there is free will or not, and whether or not God grants faith or not. I am firmly historic Protestant, but moderate in the distinctives. -->

<!-- I believe he does grant faith to the elect, it is simply my understanding of who is elect and how that differs. -->

<!-- This faith then results, but does not include, obedience and good works that follow after one is saved. -->

<!-- is by faith alone and not by random selection or by human working. -->


<!-- It's deeper than arbitrary selection, reciprocation isn't a choice or an action, it's the inexplicable concept of reciprocal forelove.   -->

<!-- If it's not about facts of forseen faith -->

<!-- Is election based upon God's foreknowledge of our faith, or does God grant faith to those whom He elects unconditionally, and arbitrarily, without regard for foreseen human faith? What if the answer was neither? Where is the love in the one-sided arbitrary choice of Calvinist thelogy? Where is the lexicon support for the Arminian election by forseen faith?  -->

<!-- What if instead it was not "knowledge of facts" but instead a forefelt "foreloving" of reciprocated love irrespective of time? This isn't based on anything intellectual so it should dodge the litmus test of the Calvinists, and it should also satisfy the Arminians since its only a slight alteration from facts of faith to the deeper more emotional and intimate hypothetical reciprocation of Love that has always defied logic, reason, and facts. -->

<!-- It is the heart and not the mind. What could be more relational than faith (trust & reliance)? -->

<!-- If this is the case, one could imagine that, this foreloving being reciprocated, not by what we do or by facts known, but by that deeper more profound connection to God that exists irrespective of time or fact based knowledge. A knowing deep down and trancendent beyond knowing with the mind, upon which he elects. This is my theory. -->

<!-- How many of you chose your wives without reciprocation? It's deeper than arbitrary selection, reciprocation isn't a choice or an action, it's the inexplicable concept of reciprocal forelove.  -->

<!-- Perhaps God grants faith to whom he would have forlove with. Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ? -->

<!-- It can't be arminianism, because it's not based on forseen faith (facts of), nor works or anything like that. It's forknew relationally and reciprocally without facts of forseen faith. -->

<!-- Agape is nice, but agape returned is better. -->

<!-- If I could push my theory further, one could surmise something more amyraldian mixed with a touch of weslyanism. -->

<!-- <a name="predestination" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 Predestination & Determinism</a> -->

<!-- Without regard for foreseen human faith or good works, God in eternity past chose from among the lot of fallen humanity some to inherit eternal life. -->

<!-- - <a name="election" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 Effectual calling</a>

    The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.

3. **Belief in the Gospel**
    - Quickened by the Spirit, the minds of the elect are persuaded of the truths of the Gospel of God‚Äôs grace.
4. **Repentance**
    - Likewise enabled by the Spirit the effectually called despise and turn away from all known sins.
5. **Trust in Christ**
    - The effectually called personally commit themselves to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their life.
6. **Regeneration**
    - God creates in justified believers new life, defined as the radical reorientation of the dispositions and affections toward God.
7. **Union with Christ**
    - The Spirit unites newly born saints with Jesus Christ in a vital, spiritual, and indissoluble union. The NT describes this experiential reality by the familiar ‚Äúin Christ‚Äù motif.
8. **Justification**
    - God in turn reckons believing sinners righteous in his sight and bestows upon them the gift of eternal life.
9. **Sanctification**
    - By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.
10. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - By the application of divine power, God faithfully preserves regenerate saints in faith and hope unto the attainment of eternal life.
11. **Glorification**
    - God perfects the final and complete redemption of the believer‚Äîbody, soul, and spirit‚Äîat the Parousia of the Lord Jesus Christ.  -->

Refresh weekly for updates. This article will probably always be under construction, because I read a lot. One time I read nearly 20 books in one week. Other times I'll contemplate a simple quotation for days. When I come to a conclusion I update my views in this article.
