<!-- SevenShepherd was originally a nickname to denote a perfect or ideal Shepherd, of course I had Christ in mind. The epithet "Unseen Shepherd" used for this article, plays into the fact that I don't desire to reveal who I am, I simply wish to share the truth with others.  -->

I consider myself to be firmly [&ldquo;historic Protestant&rdquo;](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) with moderate distinctives. While I quote Calvinists & Arminians, and agree with some of their positions, I don't hold strictly to either side.

Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/) in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). [Sola fide](/assets/images/solas.jpg).

<a name="deduce" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.1 Deducing The Correct Answer</a>

- Q1. Do you believe in the devil? 
    - A1. Every Christian would respond: yes.
- Q2. Do you believe in God?
    - A2. Every Christian would respond: yes.
- Q3. Does believing in the devil make you a satanist?
    - A3. Every Christian would respond: no.
- Q4. Does believing in God make you a Christian?
    - A4. This is where confusion arises.

<!--  -->

Let's define what "Belief in" actually means.

- Q5.  The story goes something like this (based on true events): A witch astral projects to harm a Christian family, she's prevented from doing so because there are angels surrounding and protecting the family's home, clearly this witch believes in God and angels, is she saved?
    - A5. The answer is obviously no, because there is no "belief in," "faith in," "trust in," "reliance on," "approval of" God, only intellectual assent to facts. So while there may be notitia and assensus, there is no fiducia.

<!--  -->

I think [Packer](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#packer) describes this best when he delineates that saving faith is composed of three essential elements: notitia, assensus, and fiducia. "Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14)."

- The latin term notitia means 'knowledge' and refers to an "acquaintance with the content of the gospel"
- Assensus or ‘agreement’ means "recognition that the gospel is true"
- Fiducia means ‘trust and reliance’ and it speaks of the "personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one’s own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3." 

**This is the historic protestant understanding and teaching of faith and I believe this is the correct conclusion.**

<!-- > Reformed theology analysed faith as notitia (‘knowledge’, i.e. acquaintance with the content of the gospel), plus assensus (‘agreement’, i.e. recognition that the gospel is true), plus fiducia (‘trust and reliance’, i.e. personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one’s own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3). Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14). &mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford) -->

<!-- One does not need to be reformed to be a historic protestant, any more than he has to be a 5-point Calvinist in order to be reformed. The first phase of the reformation was amyraldian (moderate). -->

<a name="lexicons" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.2 Lexicons & Dictionaries</a>

The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (**TDNT "Kittel"**) defines the underlying greek word **pisteúō**: 

> 4\. pisteúō means **&ldquo;to trust&rdquo; (also &ldquo;to obey&rdquo;)**, &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; (words), and in the passive &ldquo;to enjoy confidence&rdquo; (cf. the later sense &ldquo;to confide in&rdquo;).

We can also double check with the Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (**BDAG**), **the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon**. We can see that John 3:16 falls under the second meaning described below:

> **2 to entrust oneself to an entity in complete confidence, believe (in), trust,** w. implication of total commitment to the one who is trusted. In our lit. God and Christ are objects of this type of faith that relies on their power and nearness to help, in addition to being convinced that their revelations or disclosures are true.

<!-- A quick glance at [**Mounce**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#mounce) reveals the following:

> An accurate understanding of the use of metanoeo and metanoia in the NT is essential to grasp the gospel message, because **it does not allow for someone to obtain salvation simply by intellectually believing that Jesus is the Son of God without repenting of sins and turning to live for him.** See NIDNTT-A,367. -->

<a name="james2:19" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.3 Teachings Of The Apostle James</a>

James points out that *intellectual assent to facts* is a type of belief that [**even a demon can exercise**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#carson). Colloquially: you believe in God? Whoop-dee-doo, even the demons can exercise that kind of faith, but they aren't saved! Where's your "trust in," "reliance on," God? Where's your fiducia?

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> You say you have faith, for you believe that **there is one God**.<span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[a]</span> Good for you! Even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. &mdash; James 2:19 NLT

I think [Grudem](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#grudem) describes this best when he delineates James teaching:

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus’ life and saving works, for James says, “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!” (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. — Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge), Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. pp. 861-862.

Here is some logic to consider:

<!-- Jn 6:29; Phil 1:29; -->

1. James 2:19 states that demons are believers.
2. James 2:26 equates this kind of belief (assent) with a dead or superficial faith.
3. Christians then are to have a living/saving faith (fiducia and &ldquo;resulting&rdquo; obedience).
4. Demons therefore have a "dead faith," the kind we're not supposed to have.
5. If demons cannot repent, and repentance is granted (Ac 11:18; 2Ti 2:25), then they're by definition unrepentant as well.
6. A dead faith is a faith that even a demon can exercise.
7. A living faith is a faith only the elect can exercise (Jn 6:29; Phil 1:29)

The elect are believers. This statement takes no stance on the conditionality or unconditionality of election in this section.

<a name="legal" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.4 Legalistic False Assurance</a>

Jesus warning on the sermon on the mount taught that many would come to him in the last days saying &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; these people come to Jesus fully assured that they belong to him, and he rejects them, thereby exposing their assurance as counterfeit. Let's examine why that is the case:

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ <span style="color:#009933;">will enter the kingdom of heaven</span>, but <span style="color:#009933;">the one who does the will of my Father</span> who is in heaven. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord,</span> <span style="color:orangered;">did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?</span>’ <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">And then will I declare to them, ‘I never [knew](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#foreknew) you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:21-23

Here we can identify three types of individuals exhibiting assent to facts (notitia and assensus) but not "trust and reliance" (fiducia) that defines genuine saving faith.

1. <span style="color:orangered;">&ldquo;did we not prophesy in your name&rdquo;</span>
2. <span style="color:orangered;">&ldquo;and cast out demons in your name&rdquo;</span>
3. <span style="color:orangered;">&ldquo;and do many mighty **works** in your name?&rdquo;</span>

These all seem to me, to be legalistic pleas. They are all appealing to God, their works, as a reason why they should be admitted into heaven. Instead they should have had "trust and reliance" upon God's grace through faith only. This is why it's important to teach <span style="color:#009933;">&ldquo;resulting&rdquo; obedience</span> to God instead of <span style="color:orangered;">&ldquo;including&rdquo; obedience</span>. **You cannot merit your own salvation, and if you rely on your own efforts you're doomed.**

> Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague &mdash; [**Dr. J. I. Packer**](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8) (Ph.D., University of Oxford) [Concise Theology. Chapter 65 Legalism. p. 191.](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A)

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)

<a name="saving" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.2 Saving Faith Is Salvific</a>

**I dedicated an entire [article](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) to this topic. Please [read](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) it.**

<a name="alone" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.1 By Grace Through Faith Alone</a>

Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). [Sola fide](/assets/images/solas.jpg). 

<!-- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God and good works that "follow after" justification. -->

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me**. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.” &mdash; John 14:21 NLT (cf. Jn 14:15).

While works definitely **do not** save us, they do spring forth from a true and lively faith.

- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
- Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
- The practice of unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (1 Cor. 5:12-13; Luke 17:3-4)
- Those who practice lifelong habitual sin are likely self-deceived (James 1:22; 2 Pe 2:21-22) and will not inherit the kingdom of God (Mt 18:3; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5 ... + Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32)
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (Mt 10:38; 16:24; Lk 9:23,62; 14:27; Mk 8:34... Mt 3:10; 25:30; Jn 15:8 ESV)
- True Christians love God by obeying him (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4).
- True Christians love other believers (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10,14; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
- The Bible teaches us to live Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; 2 Pe 2:21-22).
- The teaching of obedience to God after justification is not burdensome, in fact it's a reason for joy (1 Jn 5:3-4; Jn 15:10-11).

These quotations make clear that this teaching is sound, neither legalistic, nor antinomian.

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)

> **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.** Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‘faith apart from observing the law’, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">if ‘good works’ (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith</span>, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">justifying faith (fiducia) is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not yet ours</span></span>. &mdash; [Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford), Concise Theology. Chapter 59 Works. p. 174.](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo)

<a name="repentance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.2 Repentance Is An Immediate Fruit Of Genuine Saving Faith</a>

Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith, and is defined as a turning away from sin to God that leads to salvation and eternal life. Unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (2Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18; Acts 26:15-20; Acts 3:19; Luke 17:3-4; 1Cor. 5:12-13)

- Repentance is **a turning away from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is **a Godly sorrow** that **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance is necessary (Lk 13:3) **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5)

<a name="living" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.3 Living Faith v. Dead Faith</a>

James rejects salvation by dead faith (James 2:14-26). Put another way, James rejects salvation by superficial faith, because faith is the instrument by which we lay hold of grace. Paul tells us to test for genuine faith, or a living faith, because Christ lives in you (2 Cor. 13:5).

<!-- There are two verses in the Bible that talk about the difference between a dead faith and a living faith. The first such instance is in James 2:14-26 where James implies that a *dead faith* is not the kind of faith that saves.  -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if **someone** says he has faith but does not have works? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Can that faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">save him</span>?</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> So also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">faith by itself, if it does not have works, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:14-17 ESV

James goes on to say that *intellectual assent to facts* is a type of belief that **even a demon can exercise**. We can conclude that if it's not a dead faith that saves, then the faith that justifies is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive, and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus’ life and saving works, for James says, “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!” (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. — Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge), Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. pp. 861-862.

We can also draw this same conclusion from second corinthians. We can see that the Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

> Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test! &mdash; 2 Corinthians 13:5

The reason I have spent the time explaining the difference between a dead faith and a living faith is to describe how people fall into the heresy of antinomianism. It would seem there is a growing concern over this form of false assurance; there are actually teachers out there who violate the message of the Apostles (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62), falsely teaching that God's grace allows us to live immoral lives, which the Bible does not support in any way, shape, or form.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you—men who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe—<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">ungodly men</span> who have turned the grace of our God into a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">license for evil</span></span> and who <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">deny our only <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Master and Lord</span>, Jesus Christ</span>. &mdash; Jude 1:4 NET

It's true that we are saved by grace and faith alone (Eph 2:8-10), but it's also true that saving faith results in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that follow after justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">If someone claims, “I know God,” but doesn’t obey God’s commandments, <span style="color:orangered;">that person is a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">liar</span> and is not living in the truth</span>.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> But those who **obey** God’s word truly show how completely they love him. **That is how we know** we are living in him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.</span> &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 [NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A36%3B+1Jn+2%3A3-6&version=ESV;NET;NLT)

When you profess Christ truly, you walk as he walked. We're not saved by this walk, but that's what happens as a result of a genuine profession of faith. The answer to all of these questions should be: Yes!

1. Are you saved according to Eph. 2:8-10?
2. Do you love God according to John 14:15,21?
3. Do you see the fruits (Gal. 5:22-23) and evidences (James 2:14-26) of a true and lively faith?

<!-- We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only have you proven that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but that your profession of faith was false (1Jn 2:3-6).  -->

The Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

<a name="sanctify" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.3 Progressive Sanctification</a>

Christians undergo a progressive sanctification of decreasing patterns of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Ro 6:1-2,15). While the scriptures teach that a living or saving faith &ldquo;results&rdquo; in obedience to God, it does not teach that it &ldquo;includes&rdquo; obedience, nor does it teach perfectionism. Obedience is only seen as a fruit of genuine saving faith, and only as an evidence not a proof.

<!-- <a name="repentance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.2 Repentance Is An Immediate Fruit Of Genuine Saving Faith</a> -->

These verses prove that Christians do not pursue lifestyles of indulgent sin. We are not under the law, we are under grace, yet we still do not make a practice of sinning.

1. We're not under the law (Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. We're under grace (Eph 2:8-10)
3. We still don't make a "practice" of sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31).

- The Bible does not support limited atonement:

- St. Augustine and virtually every other church father did not hold to limited atonement.
- Luther & John Calvin did not hold to limited atonement either.
- Jonathan Edwards was likely a hypothetical universalist.

**14.1.7 Hypothetical Universalism**
>
Some English theologians proposed a slightly different argument than Amyraut.<sup>116</sup> Again, the point of disagreement lay more on the intent of the atonement than on election and reprobation. **Edmund Calamy (1600–1666), a member of the Westminster Assembly, held that Christ died absolutely for the elect and conditionally for the reprobate, in case they believe.** In this context, Calamy preserved the congruence in the works of the Trinity and avoided a split between the atonement and the intercession of Christ.<sup>117</sup> Calamy distinguished his position from Arminianism. Arminians say Christ paid a price placing all in an equal state of salvation. Calamy insisted his views “doth neither intrude upon either [the] doctrine of speciall election or speciall grace.” He argued that Arminianism asserted that Christ simply suffered; all people are placed in a potentially salvable situation, so that any who believe will be saved. In contrast, he believed Christ’s death saves his elect and grants a conditional possibility of salvation to the rest.<sup>118</sup> In distinction from Amyraut, Calamy held that the atonement is efficacious for the elect. Calamy’s views were not seen as posing a major threat to the Reformed consensus.

<a name="demarest" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">3.1.2 Demarest on Proginṓskō</a>

> We observe, first, that the foundation of the Christian’s calling to salvation is God’s prothesis, meaning “purpose,” “resolve,” or “decision” (Rom 9:11; Eph 1:11; 3:11; 2 Tim 1:9). The believer’s hope of future glory is grounded not in his own will but in the sovereign, pre-temporal purpose of God. 
>
The first of the aorist verbs in the passage is the word proginōskō, to “foreknow,” “choose beforehand.”<sup>111</sup> With humans as subject the word means to “know beforehand” (Acts 26:5; 2 Pet 3:17). With God as subject the verb could mean either prescience or foreloving/foreordaining (Rom 8:29; 11:2; 1 Pet 1:20). The foundational verbs yâdaʻ and ginōskō often mean to “perceive,” “understand,” and “know.” But they also mean “to set regard upon, to know with particular interest, delight, affection, and action. (Cf. Gen 18:19; Exod 2:25; Ps 1:6; 144:3; Jer 1:5; Amos 3:2; Hos 13:5; Matt 7:23; 1 Cor 8:3; Gal 4:9; 2 Tim 2:19; 1 John 3:1).”<sup>112</sup> The verb ginōskō thus can convey God’s intimate acquaintance with his people, specifically the fact that they are “foreloved” or “chosen.” This latter sense is evident in the following Pauline sayings: “the man who loves God is known by God” (1 Cor 8:3); “but now that you know God—or rather are known by God” (Gal 4:9); and “the Lord knows those that are his” (2 Tim 2:19).
>
The verb proginōskō in Rom 8:29 and 11:2 contextually could be taken in either of the two senses, i.e., prescience or foreordination. But given the strongly relational Hebrew background to the word, the unambiguous sense of proginōskō in 1 Pet 1:20 (see below) and prognōsis in Acts 2:23 and 1 Pet 1:2 (see below), and the whole tenor of Paul’s theology, the probable meaning of proginōskō with God as subject is to “know intimately” or “forelove.”<sup>113</sup> F.F. Bruce concurs with this judgment. Concerning Rom 8:29, he wrote, “the words ‘whom he did foreknow’ have the connotation of electing grace which is frequently implied by the verb ‘to know’ in the Old Testament. When God takes knowledge of his people in this special way, he sets his choice upon them.”<sup>114</sup> To the preceding considerations we add that the biblical language of foreknowledge is always used of saints, never of the unsaved. Moreover, what God “foreknows” is the
saints themselves, not any decision or action of theirs. Thus divine election is according to foreknowledge (foreloving), not simply according to foresight (prescience).
> 
Paul continues in the Romans text: “For those God foreknew he also predestined [proōrisen] to be conformed to the likeness of his Son . . .” (v. 29). The verb proōrizō, to “decide beforehand,” or “predestine,” occurs six times in the NT in the sense of God’s predetermined plan of salvation, Christ’s sufferings, or gracious election to life (Rom 8:29-30; 1 Cor 2:7; Eph 1:5, 11). Those on whom God in eternity past set his affection, he sovereignly chose for life. 
>
Return for a moment to the larger picture of the golden chain of salvation presented in Rom 8:29-30. The verbs “foreknew,” “predestined,” “called,” “justified,” and “glorified” are in the aorist tense, which denotes God’s prior determination marking these future events with certainty. Moreover the verbs gramatically are in exact sequence; thus if the election and the calling were exclusively corporate, so also would be the justification and the glorification. But God does not justify an empty class; he justifies individuals within the class who are moved to saving faith in Christ. Similarly, it is individuals who possess the Spirit (v. 23), who “groan inwardly” awaiting the day of glorification (v. 23), who exercise “hope” (v. 24), and who display patience (v. 25). Clearly these are spiritual experiences of individual Christians who, when considered aggregately, constitute the class of believers. Thus the focus of the circle of salvation is both corporate and individual.<sup>115</sup> ...

Another possible meaning is &ldquo;to know before the time of speaking,&rdquo; as in Acts 26:5.

The other three uses of the verb and the two uses of the noun refer to divine foreknowledge. Peter in his Pentecost message indicates that Jesus was delivered over to his enemies "by God's set purpose and foreknowledge" (Acts2:23).In fact, Jesus was divinely "chosen" to this task "before" the creation of the world (l Pet. 1:20). Peter also states that believers "have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God" (l Pet. l:2). Paul emphasizes the same message, .that "those God foreknew

> 8:29 foreknew. Perhaps “knew ahead of time” (see Acts 26:5; 2 Pet 3:17, where the same Greek word is used): God “foreknew” who would believe in him and so predestined them. But “know” probably has the biblical sense of “enter into relationship with” (see Gen 18:19; Jer 1:5; Amos 3:2, where the same Hebrew word is translated “chosen,” “knew,” and “chosen,” respectively): God chose to initiate a relationship with people “before the creation of the world” (Eph 1:4; cf. Rom 11:2; Acts 2:23; 1 Pet 1:2, 20) and on that basis “predestined” them. &mdash; NIV, Biblical Theology Study Bible

> ... Foreknew reaches back to the OT, where the word “know” emphasizes God’s special choice of, or covenantal affection for, his people (e.g., Gen. 18:19; Jer. 1:5; Amos 3:2). See Rom. 11:2, where “foreknew” functions as the contrast to “rejected,” showing that it emphasizes God’s choosing his people (see also 1 Pet. 1:2, 20). God also predestined (i.e., predetermined) that those whom he chose beforehand would become like Christ. &mdash; ESV Study Bible

> 8:29 God foreknew, which means simply “to know beforehand.” This has been interpreted by some as God’s free and merciful choice of certain people who would receive His gift of salvation. Those who hold this view contend that His knowledge of future events and people did not determine His choice (see 1 Pet. 1:2). Instead He chose those who would be saved out of His own free will. Others believe that in His wisdom, God knew beforehand those who would respond to Him in faith. According to both views, only God saves; people never earn salvation through any work.

To predestine means “to mark out beforehand,” “to establish one’s boundary, or one’s limits, beforehand.” Our English word horizon is a derivative of this Greek word. The Christian’s ultimate destiny or horizon has been fixed
by God from all eternity: to be made like His Son. Note how the words predestined, called, justified, and especially glorified in Rom. 8:29, 30 are in the past tense. That is because God, from His eternal perspective, sees this process as having been completed already. From God’s perspective, we have been glorified already because He sees us righteous because of the work of Jesus on the Cross. But still, in the march of time, we must undergo the process of being conformed to the image of God’s Son.

Firstborn, see v. 16–17; see also Col 1.15. 30: Glorified, is in the past tense, like “called” and “justified”; unlike v. 17, Paul sees temporality both from the human and divine perspective: though from our perspective being glorified is future, from God’s perspective it has already occurred since it is God’s will; see also v. 29n. &mdash; New Oxford Annotated (NOAB)

<!-- Like the scholars and lexicons suggest, it's not about knowing facts, logic, reason, choices, will, or decisions of what someone will do or decide, as no relationship exists or lasts based on knowledge alone, but it is instead a more profound &ldquo;foreloving&rdquo;. -->

Take reformed theology, apply unlimited atonement or a hypothetical universalist system like [Amyraldism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/), and replace the arbitrary nature of election for a reciprocated "forelove" not based on cognitive assent, but on the genuine dispositions of the heart and the fiducial nature of genuine saving faith, and you'll arrive at my theological position.

<!-- While I believe that all Protestants have members among the saved within the invisible Church, some of their theologies leave much to be desired: -->

<!-- The only thing that I would alter is that this foreloving is prescient upon it's reciprocity, not in the way of facts of forseen faith, or human free will like in Arminianism, but instead something much more profound. Deeper also, than the one-sided arbitrary choice of Calvinist theology. Not "knowledge of facts" but instead a forefelt "foreloving" of reciprocated love irrespective of time. It describes the deeper inexplicable and enigmatic ways of reciprocal love that has always defied logic, reason, facts, choice, will or decision.

A forelove, deep, transcendant, intimate, and reciprocal, beyond the spatiotemporal limitations of human understanding or free decision. Neither by arbitrary or random selection (cal.), nor by facts of forseen faith (arm.), but a deeper foreloving by the heart he did foreknow.

- Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ?
- How many of you chose your wives or husbands without reciprocation? None that I know of.
- When has love ever been a pre-planned, scheduled event?
- People don't control or decide the way their hearts feel.
- When you're in love, you "just know," it's not about free will or decision.
- This reciprocation was never a logical decision was it.
- How could something heartfelt (primary) be a human decision (secondary).
- We were made in the image of God but both sides are stuck on the brain instead of the heart where it should be (reciprocal love that transcends time).
- What could be more love based than faith (trust and reliance)?
- Foreknowledge is non-causative. I know the sun will rise tomorrow, have I caused it to happen? No. The culpability of those involved in Christ’s predestined crucifixion should demonstrate this (Acts 2:23 NET).
- Foreknowledge of reciprocated love in genuine faith is not a work (Ro 4:5).
- If salvation is by faith only and you don't acknowledge faith as being a part of election, then you're contradicting yourself when you say that we're saved by faith only.
- We're saved by grace through faith (Eph. 2:8-9), so faith must have something to do with the election process, the only thing I'd point out is that it's not the works or actions of a choice or decision, but the heart change and reciprocation.
- Faith alone is not a decision (of the mind), it is a disposition (of the heart). Assenting to facts even a demon (James 2:19), or computer can do.

This is my conclusion. My conclusion seems to have no name, but it does acknowledge predestination (election not reprobation). It also does not require or play upon human free will or choice since that would be works. At the same time it is not an anti-free will theory per se, just that it isn't needed to satisfy the requirements of this scriptual puzzle. While this theory is still under development, I'd like to "marry" this idea with a hypothetical universalist system (Les hypothètiques) or amyraldianism. So in overview: -->

<!-- - 🚫 In [Calvinist theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-calvinist/) there's an arbitrary election of those to receive saving faith. Salvation then, isn't based on faith alone, but by a random or arbitrary selection alone. 
    - Hopefully you win the lottery. Good luck.
- 🚫 In [Arminian theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-arminian/) salvation is prescient upon forseen human faith which is probably correct, but they put too strong an emphasis on human free will and decision so as to make it feel like a work. So then salvation is not by faith alone, but by works and decisions alone. 
    - Hopefully you don't have <a href="#legal">legalistic false assurance</a>.
- 🚫 In modern neotheologies, like extreme forms of the 80s "free grace" movement, salvation is by blind faith (evidenceless) and assent (which is delusional); these teachings flirt with the heresy of [antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/antinomian-heresy/) and twist the meaning of [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/).
    - Hopefully you don't have the <a href="#dead">false assurance of a dead or superficial faith</a>. -->

While I believe that all Protestants have members among the saved within the invisible Church, some of their theologies leave much to be desired. In my theology salvation is prescient upon the fiducial nature of genuine saving faith. It answers the question: &ldquo;what is foreknowledge based upon?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;foreknowledge of what?&rdquo; Reciprocated "forelove" via fiducia. So then salvation is neither by random selection, nor by human works, but instead salvation is by grace through genuine faith.

<!-- In my theology salvation is prescient upon reciprocated forelove within the genuine dispositions of the heart and the fiducial nature of genuine saving faith. So then salvation is neither by random selection, nor by human works, but instead salvation is by grace through genuine faith. -->

- Foreknowledge is non-causative. I know the sun will rise tomorrow, have I caused it to happen? No. The culpability of those involved in Christ’s predestined crucifixion should demonstrate this (Acts 2:23 NET).
- Foreknowledge of reciprocated love in genuine faith is not a work (Ro 4:5). πιστεύω (pisteuō) is the same word used in John 3:16.

<!-- - Some do not teach trust and reliance on the person of Christ, these people are likely not saved. -->

<!-- - Moderate forms hold to an evidence-based faith like most rational groups but still butcher [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/). -->

As far as I can articluate right now, my theology is a hybrid between [Amyraldianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) and [Reformed Wesleyanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/). Two moderate views that better describe the first wave of the reformation and their founders. Here are some additonal thoughts that are **subject to change**:

<!-- My slightly altered [Amyraldian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) theology, which you could say is slightly Reformed Wesleyan in it's election view, is still being developed. Here are some additonal thoughts that are **subject to change**: -->

- It's possible that "before the foundation of the world" (Eph. 1:4), implies, that God's electing "forelove" was prescient upon a hypothetical future not corrupted by total depravity. This would neither interfere with total depravity in our reality nor the need of being rescued by the Sovereign Lord.
- By keeping God's foreknowledge hypothetical upon those who would have reciprocated him had there not been a fall, the position of regeneration could stay the same.

I also believe that my theory works irrespective of human free will. In other words, believe what you want on that, because its not about the head it's about the heart.

- Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ?
- How many of you chose your wives or husbands without reciprocation? None that I know of.
- When has love ever been a pre-planned, scheduled event?
- People don't control or decide the way their hearts feel.
- When you're in love, you "just know," it's not about free will or decision.
- This reciprocation was never a logical decision was it.
- We were made in the image of God but both sides are stuck on the brain instead of the heart where it should be (reciprocal love that transcends time).
- What could be more love based than faith (trust and reliance)?
- Faith alone is not a decision (of the mind), it is a disposition (of the heart). Assenting to facts even a demon (James 2:19), or computer can do.
- Notice how we are judged by the secrets of our hearts (Ro 2:16 NET, 1 Sam 16:7 NET; Ps 139:1-2 NLT; Jer 17:10 NLT).

<!-- - ✅ In my theology salvation is prescient upon reciprocated love within genuine saving faith. The heart change and disposition that makes faith genuine (beyond works or choice). So then salvation is neither by random selection nor by human decision, but instead salvation is by faith alone. -->

<!-- The Calvinist can't be saved unless faith is given to him, the Arminian must make the decision, a choice, perform an action; my theology is neither, but focuses directly on the genuine dispositions of the heart like both groups technically do, but without the arbirtary election process, or human workings.

My theory works irrespective of whether there is free will or not, and whether or not God grants faith or not. I am firmly historic Protestant, but moderate in the distinctives. -->

<!-- I believe he does grant faith to the elect, it is simply my understanding of who is elect and how that differs. -->

<!-- This faith then results, but does not include, obedience and good works that follow after one is saved. -->

<!-- is by faith alone and not by random selection or by human working. -->


<!-- It's deeper than arbitrary selection, reciprocation isn't a choice or an action, it's the inexplicable concept of reciprocal forelove.   -->

<!-- If it's not about facts of forseen faith -->

<!-- Is election based upon God's foreknowledge of our faith, or does God grant faith to those whom He elects unconditionally, and arbitrarily, without regard for foreseen human faith? What if the answer was neither? Where is the love in the one-sided arbitrary choice of Calvinist thelogy? Where is the lexicon support for the Arminian election by forseen faith?  -->

<!-- What if instead it was not "knowledge of facts" but instead a forefelt "foreloving" of reciprocated love irrespective of time? This isn't based on anything intellectual so it should dodge the litmus test of the Calvinists, and it should also satisfy the Arminians since its only a slight alteration from facts of faith to the deeper more emotional and intimate hypothetical reciprocation of Love that has always defied logic, reason, and facts. -->

<!-- It is the heart and not the mind. What could be more relational than faith (trust & reliance)? -->

<!-- If this is the case, one could imagine that, this foreloving being reciprocated, not by what we do or by facts known, but by that deeper more profound connection to God that exists irrespective of time or fact based knowledge. A knowing deep down and trancendent beyond knowing with the mind, upon which he elects. This is my theory. -->

<!-- How many of you chose your wives without reciprocation? It's deeper than arbitrary selection, reciprocation isn't a choice or an action, it's the inexplicable concept of reciprocal forelove.  -->

<!-- Perhaps God grants faith to whom he would have forlove with. Why do you think we're called the bride of Christ? -->

<!-- It can't be arminianism, because it's not based on forseen faith (facts of), nor works or anything like that. It's forknew relationally and reciprocally without facts of forseen faith. -->

<!-- Agape is nice, but agape returned is better. -->

<!-- If I could push my theory further, one could surmise something more amyraldian mixed with a touch of weslyanism. -->

<a name="election" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 Predestination</a>

<!-- Without regard for foreseen human faith or good works, God in eternity past chose from among the lot of fallen humanity some to inherit eternal life. -->

<!-- - <a name="election" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 Effectual calling</a>

    The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.

3. **Belief in the Gospel**
    - Quickened by the Spirit, the minds of the elect are persuaded of the truths of the Gospel of God’s grace.
4. **Repentance**
    - Likewise enabled by the Spirit the effectually called despise and turn away from all known sins.
5. **Trust in Christ**
    - The effectually called personally commit themselves to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their life.
6. **Regeneration**
    - God creates in justified believers new life, defined as the radical reorientation of the dispositions and affections toward God.
7. **Union with Christ**
    - The Spirit unites newly born saints with Jesus Christ in a vital, spiritual, and indissoluble union. The NT describes this experiential reality by the familiar “in Christ” motif.
8. **Justification**
    - God in turn reckons believing sinners righteous in his sight and bestows upon them the gift of eternal life.
9. **Sanctification**
    - By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.
10. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - By the application of divine power, God faithfully preserves regenerate saints in faith and hope unto the attainment of eternal life.
11. **Glorification**
    - God perfects the final and complete redemption of the believer—body, soul, and spirit—at the Parousia of the Lord Jesus Christ.  -->
