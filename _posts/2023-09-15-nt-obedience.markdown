New Testament obedience to Christ is characterized by a heartfelt commitment to follow His commands, rooted in love and desire to emulate His example, which is distinct from the legalistic adherence to the Mosaic Law found in the Old Testament.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If you love me, **you will** obey my commandments. ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> The person who has my commandments and obeys them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal myself to him.‚Äù &mdash; John 14:15,21 NET

If you thought obedience to Christ had anything to do with legalism, I recommend better theology teachers.

<!-- > <sub style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> For this is the love of God: that we keep his commandments. And **his commandments do not weigh us down**, <sub style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> because everyone who has been fathered by God conquers the world. &mdash; 1 John 5:3-4 NET -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> Loving God means keeping his commandments, and **his commandments are not burdensome**. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For every child of God defeats this evil world, and we achieve this victory through our faith. &mdash; 1 John 5:3-4 NLT

While obedience does not save, it does spring forth from a true and lively faith.

- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
- Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
- The practice of unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (1 Cor. 5:12-13; Luke 17:3-4)
- Those who practice lifelong habitual sin are self-deceived (James 1:22; 2 Pe 2:21-22) and will not inherit the kingdom of God (Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:3-5)
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (Mt 10:38; 16:24; Lk 9:23,62; 14:27; Mk 8:34... Mt 3:10; 25:30; Jn 15:8 ESV)
- True Christians love God by obeying him (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4).
- True Christians love other believers (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
- The Bible teaches us to live Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; 2 Pe 2:21-22).
- The teaching of obedience to God after justification is not burdensome, in fact it's a reason for joy (1 Jn 5:3-4; Jn 15:10-11).
