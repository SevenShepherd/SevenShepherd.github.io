> For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 1:18 KJV

> And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 12:12 KJV

> The Lord says,<br>
>>“I will put a curse on people<br>
who trust in mere human beings,<br>
who depend on mere flesh and blood for their strength,<br>
and whose hearts have turned away from the Lord.
>
&mdash; Jeremiah 17:5 NET
