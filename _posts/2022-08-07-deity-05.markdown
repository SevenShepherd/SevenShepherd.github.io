- NET Bible Translator Notes
    
    > c. John 1:1 NET tn Or “and what God was the Word was.” Colwell’s Rule is often invoked to support the translation of θεός (theos) as definite (“God”) rather than indefinite (“a god”) here. However, Colwell’s Rule merely permits, but does not demand, that a predicate nominative ahead of an equative verb be translated as definite rather than indefinite. Furthermore, Colwell’s Rule did not deal with a third possibility, that the anarthrous predicate noun may have more of a qualitative nuance when placed ahead of the verb. A definite meaning for the term is reflected in the traditional rendering “the word was God.” From a technical standpoint, though, it is preferable to see a qualitative aspect to anarthrous θεός in John 1:1c NET (ExSyn 266-69). Translations like the NEB, REB, and Moffatt are helpful in capturing the sense in John 1:1c NET, that the Word was fully deity in essence (just as much God as God the Father). However, in contemporary English “the Word was divine” (Moffatt) does not quite catch the meaning since “divine” as a descriptive term is not used in contemporary English exclusively of God. The translation “what God was the Word was” is perhaps the most nuanced rendering, conveying that everything God was in essence, the Word was too. This points to unity of essence between the Father and the Son without equating the persons. However, in surveying a number of native speakers of English, some of whom had formal theological training and some of whom did not, the editors concluded that the fine distinctions indicated by “what God was the Word was” would not be understood by many contemporary readers. Thus the translation “the Word was fully God” was chosen because it is more likely to convey the meaning to the average English reader that the Logos (which “became flesh and took up residence among us” in John 1:14 NET and is thereafter identified in the Fourth Gospel as Jesus) is one in essence with God the Father. The previous phrase, “the Word was with God,” shows that the Logos is distinct in person from God the Father.sn And the Word was fully God. John’s theology consistently drives toward the conclusion that Jesus, the incarnate Word, is just as much God as God the Father. This can be seen, for example, in texts like John 10:30 NET (“The Father and I are one”), John 17:11 NET (“so that they may be one just as we are one”), and John 8:58 NET (“before Abraham came into existence, I am”). The construction in John 1:1c NET does not equate the Word with the person of God (this is ruled out by 1:1b, “the Word was with God”); rather it affirms that the Word and God are one in essence.

## Conclusion

🚫 <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#C00000;">BEWARE:</span> the cultists known as [Jehovah Witnesses](https://carm.org/world-religions/jehovahs-witnesses/). This cult, in an act of unparalleled bias, has deliberately changed the underlying greek text to conform to their false doctrines by inserting articles where they don't belong. To defend against this, please read [this article](https://carm.org/jehovahs-witnesses/john-11-the-word-was-a-god/).

⚠️ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#E8AA00;">Warning:</span> The cults will attempt to twist the word begotten ([μονογενής, ές (monogenés)](https://biblehub.com/greek/3439.htm)) and force it to mean that Jesus was "created" in a feeble attempt to strip Jesus of his deity. Consider John 3:16 where Jesus is speaking to a Pharisee by the name of Nicodemus:

> “For God [speaking of the Father] so loved the world that He gave His **only begotten** Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”

Educated Greek scholars and professors reveal that [monogenés](https://biblehub.com/greek/3439.htm) comes from two Greek terms: monos meaning “one” and the noun genes which means “kind” or “type.” So, you put these two words together and you have monogenes which means: <span style="font-style:italic;color:Green;">“unique,” “only,” or “one of its kind.”</span>

That’s what Jesus is talking about in John 3:16. He is not saying that God the Father created Him. He’s saying that He is God’s only, unique, one of a kind Savior! This is why Peter could boldly pronounce to the Sanhedrin in Acts 4:12:

> “…there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved.”

Jesus is the “monogenes,” the only, one of a kind Savior! There is salvation in no one else. That’s what John 3:16 is saying.
