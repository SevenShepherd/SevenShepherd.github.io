## ⚠️ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Gold;">Under Construction</span>

Hello, this article is a work in progress. When this warning sign is taken down it will be finished. I will continue to add what I find. Feel free to contact me below with suggestions.

## 🗺️ **Legend / Key**

- ⚜️ **Identified As Yahweh** 

	*Instances that reveal Jesus to be, not only God, but Yahweh, the covenant name of God, are marked with a Fleur-de-lis.* 
	
	<!--The Cults have done there best to hide, mistranslate, and erase these instances.-->

- 📜 **Referred To As Yahweh**

	*Instances where monotheistic Old Testament passages which, uniquely referred to Yahweh, are applied to the Lord Jesus Christ.* 
	
	<!--The cults may have overlooked this instances.*-->

- 🧠 **Deduced To Be Yahweh**

	*Instances where logic is used to deduce that Jesus Is Yahweh God.*
	
	<!--These instances are especially effective against the cults, who have altered most the other instances in order to hide Jesus Deity.*-->

- 👑 **Specifically Called God**

	*Instances where Jesus is called "God" or "Deity" within the verse.*
