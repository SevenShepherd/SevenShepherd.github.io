## ⚠️ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Gold;">Under Construction</span>

Hello, this article is a work in progress. When this warning sign is taken down it will be finished. I will continue to add what I find. Feel free to contact me below with suggestions.

## 🗺️ **Legend / Key**

- ⚜️ **Identified As God**

	*Instances where Jesus is called "God" or "Deity" within the verse, are marked with a Fleur-de-lis.*

- <span style="font-size:20px;">👑 **Identified As Yahweh**</span>

	*Instances that reveal Jesus to be, not only God, but Yahweh, the covenant name of God*
	
	<!--The Cults have done there best to hide, mistranslate, and erase these instances.-->

	- 📜 **Referred To As Yahweh**

		*Instances where monotheistic Old Testament passages which, uniquely referred to Yahweh, are applied to the Lord Jesus Christ.* 
		
		<!--The cults may have overlooked this instances.*-->

	- 🧠 **Deduced To Be Yahweh**

		*Instances where logic is used to deduce that Jesus Is Yahweh God.*
		
		<!--These instances are especially effective against the cults, who have altered most the other instances in order to hide Jesus Deity.*-->

- 🍃 **Nature Of God**

	*Instances that show Jesus equality with The Father in nature and essence.*
