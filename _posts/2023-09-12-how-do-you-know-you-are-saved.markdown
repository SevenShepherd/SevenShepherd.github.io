<!-- When You Profess Christ Truly, You Walk As He Walked. We're Not Saved By This Walk, But That's What Happens As A Result Of A Genuine Profession -->

## I. Christians Do Not Live Lifestyles Of Indulgent Sin

# We are not under the law, we are under grace, yet we still do not make a practice of sinning

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> What shall we say then? **Are we to remain in sin** so that grace may increase? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> **Absolutely not!** How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> What then? **Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!** &mdash; Romans 6:1-2,15 NET

These verses prove the following three things:
1. We're not under the law (Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. We're under grace (Eph 2:8-10)
3. We still don't make a "practice" of sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31).

<!-- # Conclusion -->

Final Thoughts

- Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/).
- Intellectual assent to facts is not salvific (James 2:19), Saving faith includes knowledge (notitia), approval (assensus), and personal trust (fiducia).
- James rejects salvation by dead faith (James 2:14-26). Put another way, James rejects salvation by superficial faith, because faith is the instrument on which we lay hold of grace.
- Paul tells us to test for genuine faith, or a living faith, because Christ lives in you (2 Cor. 13:5).

## II. Christians Experience A Godly Contrition

# Repentance is a turning away from sin to God that leads to salvation and eternal life. Unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles.

<!-- # Repentance Leads To Salvation -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> For **sadness as intended by God** produces a **repentance that leads to salvation**, leaving no regret, but worldly sadness brings about death. &mdash; 2 Corinthians 7:10 NET (cf. 8-13).

<!-- The aforementioned verse proves the following:
- Contrition leads to repentance.
- Repentance leads to salvation.
- Attrition leads to death.
- Contrition is not attrition. -->

<!-- # Repentance Leads To Eternal Life -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> When they heard this, they ceased their objections and praised God, saying, ‚ÄúSo then, God has granted the **repentance that leads to life** even to the Gentiles.‚Äù &mdash; Acts 11:18 NET

<!-- - Repentance leads to eternal life -->

<!-- # Repentance Is A Turning From Sin To God -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> but I declared to those in Damascus first, and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should **repent and turn to God, performing deeds consistent with repentance**. (See Acts 26:15-20; cf. Acts 3:19)

<!-- # The Practice Of Unrepentant Sin Was Not Tolerated By The Apostles -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> Watch yourselves! **If your brother sins, rebuke him**. If he repents, forgive him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Even if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to you saying, ‚ÄòI repent,‚Äô you must forgive him.‚Äù &mdash; Luke 17:3-4; (cf. 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT)

<!-- # Conclusion -->

Second Corinthians 7:10 proves:
- Contrition leads to repentance.
- Repentance leads to salvation.
- Attrition leads to death.
- Contrition is not attrition.

The aforementioned verses prove the following:
- Repentance is **a turning away from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance is necessary (Lk 13:3) **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5)

<!-- - Repentance is a return to the practice of righteousness, James 2:17-18; 1Jn 2:29; 1Jn 3:7 -->

## III. Christians Acknowledge Jesus As Lord Over Their Life

# Jesus is "Lord" whether you acknowledge it or not

> because if you confess with your mouth that **Jesus is Lord** and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. &mdash; Romans 10:9

> Jesus on another occasion said, "Why do you call me Lord and yet you don‚Äôt do the things that I command you?" You see, our problem is that we‚Äôve come to think of the term "Lord" as a name and so we say, "The Lord Jesus Christ" and we think of Lord as His first name, Jesus His middle name and Christ His last name; He‚Äôs the Lord Jesus Christ. **But in reality when I say the Lord, you should put a comma there for Lord is not his name; it‚Äôs His title. The title that signifies my relationship to Him. <span style="color:#29a329;">He is my Lord, I am his slave; I am his servant, He is my Lord.</span>** &mdash; Chuck Smith C2000

> The idea that there can be saving faith without repentance, and that one can be justified by **embracing Christ as Saviour while refusing him as Lord, is a destructive delusion**. &mdash; [J. I. Packer](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8) (PhD, University of Oxford). <a href="https://amzn.to/3JOaVKp">Concise Theology, 60. Repentance.</a>

Takeaways:
- I believe *"Jesus is Lord."* Anyone who can say this, and mean it, does so by the power of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). You'd be suprised at how many people only want Jesus "as savior" but not "as Lord" of their life. Both are true for the saved.
- Lord is a title not a name.

## IV. Understanding This Nuance Could Be Life And Death
# Saving faith v. Dead faith

There are two verses in the Bible that talk about the difference between a dead faith and a living faith. The first such instance is in James 2:14-26 where James implies that a *dead faith* is not the kind of faith that saves. 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if **someone** says he has faith but does not have works? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Can that faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">save him</span>?</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and filled,‚Äù without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> So also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">faith by itself, if it does not have works, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:14-17 ESV

James goes on to say that *intellectual assent to facts* is a type of belief that **even a demon can exercise**. We can conclude that if it's not a dead faith that saves, then the faith that justifies is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive, and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus‚Äô life and saving works, for James says, ‚ÄúYou believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe‚Äîand shudder!‚Äù (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. ‚Äî Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge), Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. pp. 861-862.

We can also draw this same conclusion from second corinthians. We can see that the Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

> Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?‚Äîunless indeed you fail to meet the test! &mdash; 2 Corinthians 13:5

The reason I have spent the time explaining the difference between a dead faith and a living faith is to describe how people fall into the heresy of antinomianism. It would seem there is a growing concern over this form of false assurance; there are actually teachers out there who violate the message of the Apostles (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62), falsely teaching that God's grace allows us to live immoral lives, which the Bible does not support in any way, shape, or form.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">ungodly men</span> who have turned the grace of our God into a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">license for evil</span></span> and who <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">deny our only <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Master and Lord</span>, Jesus Christ</span>. &mdash; Jude 1:4 NET

It's true that we are saved by grace and faith alone (Eph 2:8-10), but it's also true that saving faith results in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that follow after justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">If someone claims, ‚ÄúI know God,‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt obey God‚Äôs commandments, <span style="color:orangered;">that person is a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">liar</span> and is not living in the truth</span>.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> But those who **obey** God‚Äôs word truly show how completely they love him. **That is how we know** we are living in him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.</span> &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 [NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A36%3B+1Jn+2%3A3-6&version=ESV;NET;NLT)

## V. Christians Love God By Obeying Him

# Saving faith "results" in obedience to God and good works that "follow after" justification.

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me**. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.‚Äù &mdash; John 14:21 NLT (cf. Jn 14:15).

While works definitely do not save us, they do spring forth from a true and lively faith.

- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
- Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
- The practice of unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (1 Cor. 5:12-13; Luke 17:3-4)
- Those who practice lifelong habitual sin are likely self-deceived (James 1:22; 2 Pe 2:21-22) and will not inherit the kingdom of God (Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:3-5)
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (Mt 10:38; 16:24; Lk 9:23,62; 14:27; Mk 8:34... Mt 3:10; 25:30; Jn 15:8 ESV)
- True Christians love God by obeying him (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4).
- True Christians love other believers (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10,14; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
- The Bible teaches us to live Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; 2 Pe 2:21-22).
- The teaching of obedience to God after justification is not burdensome, in fact it's a reason for joy (1 Jn 5:3-4; Jn 15:10-11).

## Conclusion

Saving faith is composed of three essential elements: notitia, assensus, and fiducia. As Packer points out in Concise Theology: "Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14)." 

The latin term notitia means 'knowledge' and refers to an "acquaintance with the content of the gospel"; assensus or ‚Äòagreement‚Äô means "recognition that the gospel is true"; fiducia means ‚Äòtrust and reliance‚Äô and it speaks of the "personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one‚Äôs own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3)."

> **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.** Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‚Äòfaith apart from observing the law‚Äô, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">if ‚Äògood works‚Äô (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith</span>, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">justifying faith (fiducia) is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not yet ours</span></span>. &mdash; [Concise Theology. Chapter 59 Works. p. 174.](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A)

Justification is by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified.

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD)

When you profess Christ truly, you walk as he walked. We're not saved by this walk, but that's what happens as a result of a genuine profession of faith. The answer to all of these questions should be: Yes!

1. Are you saved according to Eph. 2:8-10?
2. Do you love God according to John 14:15,21?
3. Do you see the fruits (Gal. 5:22-23) and evidences (James 2:14-26) of a true and lively faith?

<!-- We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only have you proven that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but that your profession of faith was false (1Jn 2:3-6).  -->

We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only are you showing evidence that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but you're also showing evidence that your profession of faith is false (1Jn 2:3-6). Make sure your heart has not betrayed you (Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9), examine your faith to see if it is genuine (2Cor. 13:5 NLT).

> **Biblical faith is evidence-based.**... **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing. ... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*. p. 136, 218, 313.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#lennox)

It's true that Christians undergo a progressive sanctification of decreasing patterns of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Ro 6:1-2,15), but the faith that justifies, is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience. It is no dead faith (James 2:14-26).
