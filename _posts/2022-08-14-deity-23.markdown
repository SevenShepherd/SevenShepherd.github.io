`Highly Idiomatic Translation / Paraphrase`
- Critical Text
    > That really set them off. The Jews were now not only out to expose him; they were out to kill him. Not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was calling God his own Father, putting himself on a level with God. &mdash; John 5:18 MSG (The Message)

## Conclusion

In accordance with Leviticus 24:16, The Jews tried to kill him for blasphemy! 

> Moreover, the one who **blasphemes** the name of Yahweh shall surely be put to death; **all the congregation shall certainly stone him**. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death. &mdash; Leviticus 24:16 LSB

It was understood that Jesus was claiming to be God every time he referred to himself as the Son of God, equal to the Father in nature. The Jews took it as blasphemy. This reaction only makes sense if Jesus was claiming to be God.

<!-- > ... but for blasphemy; and **because You, being a man, make Yourself God.” -->

> For this reason therefore **the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him**, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, **making Himself equal with God.** &mdash; John 5:18 LSB

<!-- > This made ·them [the Jewish leaders; <sup>L</sup>the Jews] try still harder to kill him. They said, “First Jesus was breaking the law about the Sabbath day. Now he says that God is his own Father, **making himself equal with God!” [<sup>C</sup>Both breaking the Sabbath and blasphemy against God were punishable by death; Ex. 35:2; Lev. 24:16.]** &mdash; John 5:18 EXP (Expanded Bible) -->

Further, this didn't happen just once, but many times.

> **I and the Father are one.”** 31 The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him. 32 Jesus answered them, “I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?” 33 The Jews answered Him, **“For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself God.”** &mdash; John 10:30-33 LSB (NASB '95 61.65% / 67.99%)

> **Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.”**
57 So the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?” 58 **Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.”** 59 **Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple.** &mdash; John 8:56-59 LSB

Being called Son of God doesn't mean Jesus isn't God, Just like being called Son of Man doesn't mean you're not a man. **Everytime you hear the title 'Son of God', that is a claim to deity and equality with the personage of the Father in nature. Jesus is God!**
