Ordo Salutis
Ordo salutis is a latin phrase for “The Order of Salvation” and was first coined by Lutheran theologians Franz Buddeus and Jacob Carpov in the first half of the eighteenth century. This ministry holds to the most academically sound and historically time-tested theology known to Chrisitanity.  

Reformed Theology
Calling
The general call to trust Christ is issued through the widespread offer of the Gospel. By means of this general call God sovereignly issues a special calling to the elect. The Spirit facilitates sinners’ response to the Gospel by enlightening their minds, liberating their wills, and inclining their affections Godward.

Regeneration
Without any human assistance the third person of the Trinity creates new spiritual life, including God-honoring dispositions, affections, and habits.

Faith
Having been granted new spiritual life, the elect believe the truths of the Gospel and trust Jesus Christ as Savior. Faith is viewed as a gift and enablement of God, indeed as a consequence of new spiritual birth.

Repentance
Here believers grieve for sins committed and deliberately turn from all known disobedience. This response likewise is a divine enablement.

Justification
On the basis of Christ’s completed work, the Father reckons to believers the righteousness of his Son, remits sins, and admits the same to the divine favor. Justification is the legal declaration of believing sinners’ right standing with God.

Sanctification
The Holy Spirit works in justified believers the will and the power progressively to renounce sin and to advance in spiritual maturity and Christlikeness. By the process of sanctification God makes believers experientially holy.

Preservation and perseverance
The God who has chosen, regenerated, justified, and sealed believers with his Spirit preserves them by his faithfulness and power to the very end. True believers persevere by virtue of the divine preservation.

Glorification
God will complete the redemption of the saints when the latter behold Christ at his second advent and are transformed into his likeness.

Conclusion
This ministry holds to a monergistic theology, which rejects works based forms of salvation, and holds to the biblically sound concept of sola fide or justification by faith alone, which once justified, naturally results in obedience to God and good works that follow after justification. Therefore, "Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify."

<!-- Calvinism is a somewhat misleading label since it draws heavily from the writings of the early church father [St. Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) who lived during the 4th and 5th centuries, twelve hundred years prior to John Calvin (1509 – 1564) and the 16th century Protestant [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation). Theologians who followed the Augustinian tradition on this point included St. Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk. Everyone in this category can call themselves *Augustinian-Pauline Christians*.

> The man who most adamantly defended the Augustinian view of predestination was Martin Luther. ... Shortly after Luther's death, the Lutheran body, under the leadership of Philip Melancthon took a different turn and did not follow Martin Luther in his articulation of the view of predestination. But I think it's safe to say that Luther wrote more on predestination than Calvin ever dreamed of. &mdash; [R. C. Sproul (Ph.D., Whitefield Theological Seminary)](https://youtu.be/--fafICBts8?t=983)

✅ Reformed theology is securely [monergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/monergism/).  -->

⚠️ It should be noted that St. Augustine, Luther, & Calvin all rejected &ldquo;Limited Atonement.&rdquo; Calvin is, perhaps, better described as moderate 4-point Calvinist.

> All of this invalidates the L of TULIP – “limited atonement” –
the view that Christ did not actually die for all but only for the “elect”.
In fact, not only Luther but many of the other reformers, including
Calvin, did not subscribe to limited atonement. &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*]() p. 179.

This is the only purely monergistic theology. Denominations associated with this theological tradition of Christianity are Presbyterianism, Reformed Churches, Reformed Baptists, some Anglican etc.
