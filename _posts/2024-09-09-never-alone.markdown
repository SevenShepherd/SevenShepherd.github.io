<!-- True Christians practice righteousness and false ones practice sin, that much we know for certain as the Apostle John said ‚Äúwhoever does not practice righteousness is not of God‚Äù Our works don't save us, but they give evidence to our spiritual condition. -->

<!-- Justification is by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified. ‚Äúwhoever does not practice righteousness is not of God‚Äù ‚Äî The Apostle John -->

True Christians practice righteousness, and false ones practice sin; that much we know for certain, as the Apostle John said, ***‚ÄúWhoever does not practice righteousness is not of God.‚Äù*** Our works don't save us (Rom 3:28), but they give evidence of our spiritual condition (1Jn 2:3-6) and whether our faith is superficial (James 2:24) or genuine (2Cor. 13:5). If the Holy Spirit is inside of you, you will put on a new nature (2Cor 5:17) and you will no longer practice or pursue lifestyles of sin.

<!-- Just a friendly reminder to those who have been confused and mislead by the [cults](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/what-is-a-cult/) and [heretical sects](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), that only justification is by faith alone. If the Holy Spirit is inside of you, you will put on a new nature (2Cor 5:17) and you will no longer practice sin. If you do practice sin the Bible says you give great evidence (1Jn 2:3-6) that your faith is superficial (James 2:24). -->

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone has sin (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Little children, let no one deceive you.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil</span>, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">No one born of God makes a practice of sinning</span>, for God's seed abides in him; and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">he cannot keep on sinning</span>, because he has been born of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">By this it is evident</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">who are the children of God</span>, and <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:Red;">who are the children of the devil</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God</span>, nor is the one who does not love his brother. &mdash; 1 John 3:6-10

The Apostle John also [taught](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/) that we could have assurance by our fruit-bearing. It will help you to make the distinction between **(1)** justification, which is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and **(2)** assurance of salvation, which is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT; Jn 14:15,21). &ldquo;*we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.*... *That is how we know we are living in him.*&rdquo;<sup style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/">‚Ä†</a></sup>

> The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:Red;">he commands</span> all people everywhere to <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">repent</span>, &mdash; Acts 17:30 ESV
>> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">we can be sure</span> that we know him if we obey his commandments. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">If someone claims, ‚ÄúI know God,‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt obey God‚Äôs commandments, that person is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">a liar</span> and is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">not living in the truth</span>.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> But those who obey God‚Äôs word truly show how completely they love him. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">That is how we know we are living in him.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did. &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 NLT ([**article**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/))

Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen">but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified</span> (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> ‚ÄúYes, I am the vine; you are the branches. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Those who remain in me, and I in them, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:YellowGreen;">will</span> produce much fruit.</span> For apart from me you can do nothing. &mdash; [Jesus teaching &ldquo;resulting&rdquo; fruit-bearing in John 15:5 (NLT),](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/) <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">Approximately A.D. 30</span>.

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; <span style="color:#00cc44;">Historic Protestant Position</span>
