Just a friendly reminder to those who have been confused and mislead by the [cults](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/what-is-a-cult/) and [heretical sects](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), that only justification is by faith alone. If the Holy Spirit is inside of you, you will put on a new nature (2Cor 5:17) and you will no longer practice sin. If you do practice sin the Bible says your faith is superficial (James 2:24).

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone has sin (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Little children, let no one deceive you.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil</span>, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">No one born of God makes a practice of sinning</span>, for God's seed abides in him; and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">he cannot keep on sinning</span>, because he has been born of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">By this it is evident</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">who are the children of God</span>, and <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:Red;">who are the children of the devil</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God</span>, nor is the one who does not love his brother. &mdash; 1 John 3:6-10

Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen">but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified</span> (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; <span style="color:#00cc44;">Historic Protestant Position</span>

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.
