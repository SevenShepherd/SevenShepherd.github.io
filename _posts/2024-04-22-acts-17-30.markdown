<!-- The message of Good News overcomes ignorance and summons all who hear it to repent of their sins and turn to God -->

[**The true meaning of repentance**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) is **a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ**.

> The times of ignorance **God** overlooked, but now he **commands all people everywhere to repent**
>>
>>In the past, people did not understand God, and he ignored this [or God overlooked such times of ignorance]. But now, God tells [commands] all people in the world **to change their hearts and lives** [repent]. 
>
>&mdash; Acts 17:30 ESV, EXB

In the past, God didn‚Äôt judge people for what they didn‚Äôt know. But now he commands all people everywhere **to turn away from their sins**. NIRV -->

Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith (2Cor.13:5). Repentance is  an inward resolve to turn from sin to God in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5) that leads to salvation and eternal life (2Cor 7:10; Ac 11:18).

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Justification is by faith alone</span> (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified</span> (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10). Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).

We do not repent to merit or earn our salvation, we repent because our faith is genuine and we have not made a false profession of faith (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4), we repent because our love for God is not superficial (Jn 14:15,21). A faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, is not true faith. It is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26).

> The call to repent was the first and fundamental summons in the preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2), Jesus (Matt. 4:17), the Twelve (Mark 6:12), Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:38), Paul to the Gentiles (Acts 17:30; 26:20), and the glorified Christ to five of the seven churches in Asia (Rev. 2:5, 16, 22; 3:3, 19). It was part of Jesus‚Äô summary of the gospel that was to be taken to the world (Luke 24:47).

The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

- Not justifying (Rom 3:28; Eph 2:8-10).
- Imperfect (1Jn 1:8‚Äì10; 2:1-2).
- **Taught alongside faith by Christ Himself** (Mark 1:14-15).
- One of the reasons Jesus came (Lk 5:32).
- Taught as [**an inward resolve to turn from sin**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
- **An immediate fruit** of genuine saving faith resulting in good works and righteous behavior (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5).
- **Will happen** in genuine believers (1Jn 3:6-10). logically (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
- **Commanded** by God (Ac 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- **Granted** by God (Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25).
- Growth **given** by God (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4).
- Preached **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- **Produced from Godly sorrow** (2 Cor. 7:10; Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- **Leading to salvation** and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Described as **needed** and necessary (Lk 15:7).
- Repent or Perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Unrepentant sin not tolerated by the Apostles and not a one time event (Lk 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:11-13). 


<!-- - Repentance is **an inward resolve to turn from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5) -->
