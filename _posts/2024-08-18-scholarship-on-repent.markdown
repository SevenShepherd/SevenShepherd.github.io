<a name="Main" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">All English Translations Say "Repent!" And Not "Change Your Mind!"</a>

> There is yet another significant argument against the common [Free Grace](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/) definition of repentance as a mere "change of mind": the definition "change of mind" differs from all widely known English Bible translations.
> 
> Take, for example, the first instance of [metanoe≈ç](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) in the New Testament, which reports John the Baptist preaching and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matt. 3:2). This verb is translated as "repent" in the following Bible versions: KJV, NKJV, ESV, NASB, NIV, NET, HCSB, NLT, RSV, and NRSV. I know of no Bible translation that translates this verse as, "Change your minds, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." And for good reason; the English word repent does not mean merely "change your mind" but has the following meanings:
> 
> 1. To feel remorse, contrition, or self-reproach for what one has done or failed to do; be contrite. 
> 2. To feel such regret for past conduct as to change one's mind regarding it: repented of intemperate behavior. 
> 3. To make a change for the better as a result of remorse or contrition for one's sins. <sup>38</sup>
>
>> <sup>38 American Heritage Dictionary, 4th ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006), s.v. "repent."</sup>
> 
> Those are three related but slightly distinct meanings for repent. Of those three senses, the meaning that would most naturally come to mind for English-speaking readers of the New Testament would be the one connected to "sins," or meaning (3), or perhaps a combined sense of (2) and (3), including making a change for the better, or resolving to make a change for the better, "as a result of remorse or contrition for one's sins." That is the sense that is best suited to the New Testament contexts where English translators have used this word, and that is naturally the sense in which they expected it to be understood. <sup>39</sup> This is significant. It means that all the verses in the New Testament that use the word repent in English are also arguments against [the Free Grace position](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), that repent means "to change one's mind." For example:
> 
> Repent [not: Change your mind], for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. (Matt. 3:2)
> 
> From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent [not: Change your mind], for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
> 
> (Matt. 4:17) and that repentance [not: a change of mind) and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. (Luke 24:47)
> 
> And Peter said to them, "Repent [not: Change your mind] and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
> 
>> <sup>39 Even meaning (2) by itself, "To feel such regret for past conduct as to change one's mind regarding it: repented of intemperate behavior," implies not merely a change of opinion but a change in thinking so that one is resolved no longer to continue that pat- tern of behavior.</sup>
> 
> for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." (Acts 2:38)
> 
> Repent [not: Change your mind] therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out. (Acts 3:19)
> 
> The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent [not: change their minds]. (Acts 17:30)
> 
> [Paul says that he]... declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent [not: change their minds] and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance. (Acts 26:20)
> 
> These verses and others like them with the English word repent give further evidence that no committee of English Bible translators has agreed with Bing's definition, "change of mind." p. 64. <a name="Grudem-Historic" href="#Grudem"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">‚Ä†</sup></a>

<a name="Conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">Conclusion</a>

<!-- ‚ÄúI have not come to bring peace, but a sword.‚Äù -->

[The world's most authoritative Greek lexicons](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) show that the true meaning of [metano√©≈ç](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [met√°noia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) falls under the second meaning of &ldquo;*feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense)*&rdquo; as taught by Christ & The Apostles (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).

It's important for you to understand the difference between [biblical language scholars](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/#Recommended-Materials), who actually know and are educated in the meaning of Koine Greek & Biblical Hebrew words, and theologians who do not.

<!-- Being inter-denominational, non-sectarian, ecumenical, and systemless.. -->

The academic community is made up of thousands of scholars who created all the English Bible translations, lexicons, dictionaries, and interlinears. When a theologian who doesn't understand Greek tell's you that repentance is only a *&ldquo;change of mind&rdquo;* they are teaching error and on a subject they are not educated on.

<!-- >
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">It is something much harder than merely eating humble pie. It means unlearning all the self-conceit and self-will that we have been training ourselves into for thousands of years. It means killing part of yourself, undergoing a kind of death. In fact, it needs a good man to repent. And here comes the catch. Only a bad person needs to repent: only a good person can repent perfectly. The worse you are the more you need it and the less you can do it. The only person who could do it perfectly would be a perfect person‚Äîand he would not need it.</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">Remember, this repentance, this willing submission to humiliation and a kind of death, is not something God demands of you before He will take you back and which He could let you off if He chose: it is simply a description of what going back to Him is like. If you ask God to take you back without it, you are really asking Him to let you go back without going back. It cannot happen. Very well, then, we must go through with it. But the same badness which makes us need it, makes us unable to do it. Can we do it if God helps us? Yes, but what do we mean when we talk of God helping us? We mean God putting into us a bit of Himself, so to speak. He lends us a little of His reasoning powers and that is how we think: He puts a little of His love into us and that is how we love one another. When you teach a child writing, you hold its hand while it forms the letters: that is, it forms the letters because you are forming them. We love and reason because God loves and reasons and holds our hand while we do it.</span> -->

When confronted with the view that I now advocate, I was skeptical. However, I have always considered Acts 17:11 to be a vitally important attitude to have: ‚ÄúThese were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.‚Äù After following that admonition, I changed my thinking about repentance &mdash; [Dr. Bob Wilikin, Does Your Mind Need Changing?

> <span style="font-size:0.8em;"> You can say that you are sorry for what you have done but if you continue to do it, that is not true repentance. **Real repentance is being so sorry, so contrite, that you do not do it again. You turn away from it and cease doing it.** If a person declares that they have repented of a certain action or sin, and they continue in that same action, there is good reason to doubt the genuineness of the repentance. It is not a true repentance when you continue in that sin. **Repentance is the first step to salvation.** &mdash; [**Chuck Smith**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/)
