<a name="Main" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">All English Translations Say "Repent!" And Not "Change Your Mind!"</a>

> There is yet another significant argument against the common [[80s sect](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)] definition of repentance as a mere "change of mind": the definition "change of mind" differs from all widely known English Bible translations.
> 
> Take, for example, the first instance of [metanoeō](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) in the New Testament, which reports John the Baptist preaching and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matt. 3:2). This verb is translated as "repent" in the following Bible versions: KJV, NKJV, ESV, NASB, NIV, NET, HCSB, NLT, RSV, and NRSV. I know of no Bible translation that translates this verse as, "Change your minds, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." And for good reason; the English word repent does not mean merely "change your mind" but has the following meanings:
> 
> 1. To feel remorse, contrition, or self-reproach for what one has done or failed to do; be contrite. 
> 2. To feel such regret for past conduct as to change one's mind regarding it: repented of intemperate behavior. 
> 3. To make a change for the better as a result of remorse or contrition for one's sins. <sup>38</sup>
>
>> <sup>38 American Heritage Dictionary, 4th ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006), s.v. "repent."</sup>
> 
> Those are three related but slightly distinct meanings for repent. Of those three senses, the meaning that would most naturally come to mind for English-speaking readers of the New Testament would be the one connected to "sins," or meaning (3), or perhaps a combined sense of (2) and (3), including making a change for the better, or resolving to make a change for the better, "as a result of remorse or contrition for one's sins." That is the sense that is best suited to the New Testament contexts where English translators have used this word, and that is naturally the sense in which they expected it to be understood. <sup>39</sup> This is significant. It means that all the verses in the New Testament that use the word repent in English are also arguments against the [[80s movement position](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/)], that repent means "to change one's mind." For example:
> 
> Repent [not: Change your mind], for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. (Matt. 3:2)
> 
> From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent [not: Change your mind], for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
> 
> (Matt. 4:17) and that repentance [not: a change of mind) and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. (Luke 24:47)
> 
> And Peter said to them, "Repent [not: Change your mind] and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
> 
>> <sup>39 Even meaning (2) by itself, "To feel such regret for past conduct as to change one's mind regarding it: repented of intemperate behavior," implies not merely a change of opinion but a change in thinking so that one is resolved no longer to continue that pat- tern of behavior.</sup>
> 
> for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." (Acts 2:38)
> 
> Repent [not: Change your mind] therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out. (Acts 3:19)
> 
> The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent [not: change their minds]. (Acts 17:30)
> 
> [Paul says that he]... declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent [not: change their minds] and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance. (Acts 26:20)
> 
> These verses and others like them with the English word repent give further evidence that no committee of English Bible translators has agreed with Bing's definition, "change of mind." p. 64. <a name="Grudem-Historic" href="#Grudem"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">†</sup></a>

<a name="Conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">Conclusion</a>

<!-- “I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.” -->

[The world's most authoritative Greek lexicons](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) show that the true meaning of [metanoéō](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) falls under the second meaning of &ldquo;*feel remorse, repent, be converted in a (religio-)ethical sense.*&rdquo; [metánoia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) also falls under the second meaning of &ldquo;*repentance, turning about, conversion*&rdquo; as taught by Christ & The Apostles (Ac 3:19,26; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).

It's important for you to understand the difference between [biblical language scholars](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/#Recommended-Materials), who actually know and are educated in the meaning of Koine Greek & Biblical Hebrew words, and theologians who do not.

<!-- Being inter-denominational, non-sectarian, ecumenical, and systemless.. -->

The academic community is made up of thousands of scholars who created all the English Bible translations, lexicons, dictionaries, and interlinears. When a theologian who doesn't understand Greek tells you that repentance is only a *&ldquo;change of mind&rdquo;* they are teaching error and on a subject **they are not educated** on.

Every Bible version is testament to the fact that repentance is a contrition (2Cor 7:10), a hatred for sin (Jude 23 NLT), and [a turning from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repent-means-turn/) (Acts 3:26; Act 3:19). Each of these versions have hundreds of biblical language scholars that translated [metanoeō](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [metánoia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) correctly according to BDAG, the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon.

<span style="font-size:0.8em;">The [**ESV Study Bible**]() has over 200+ biblical scholars ([100+](https://www.esv.org/translation/) ESV; 95 Study); 9 countries, 20 denominations, 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities, including Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, London, Japan, California, MIT, Duke, Westminister, Dallas, etc. 20,000 study notes, 80,000 cross-references, 200+ charts, 50+ articles, 240 full-color maps and illustrations. Textual Basis: Masoretic Text BHS '83, DSS, LXX, SP, S, Vg; UBS5, NA28.</span>

> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Redemption**<br>The best-known verse in the Bible summarizes the required response to this good news: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). **To “believe in” Jesus includes both a wholehearted trust in him for forgiveness of sins and a decision to forsake one’s sin or to “repent”: All who truly “repent [or turn from their sins] and believe [in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins]” will be redeemed (Mark 1:15) and restored to a right relationship with God.** To “believe in” Jesus also requires relating to, and putting trust in, Jesus as he truly is—not just a man in ancient history but also a living Savior today who knows our hearts and hears our prayers. &mdash; God's Plan of Salvation, Redemption.</span>

> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Response**<br>
So if God has done this in Christ, what are we to do to be saved? **We must turn to God in Christ**, which entails **turning back from sin**. If we repent of (**decide to forsake and turn from**) our sin (as best we understand it) and **trust in Christ as a living person**, we will be saved from God’s righteous wrath against our sins. ...</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Turn to God.** In the OT, God commands people to turn or return to him, and so be saved (e.g., Isa. 6:10; Jer. 18:8). In the NT, **Christ preached that people should turn to God**, and Paul summarized his account of his preaching with that phrase: “that they [everyone] should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance” (Acts 26:20; cf. Acts 26:18). Thus, as Paul said earlier, he preached “testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ” (Acts 20:21). **To repent means to turn. And the turning that we are called to do in order to be saved is fundamentally a turning to God.** James could refer to the Gentiles who **“turn to God”** (Acts 15:19). To **“turn to,”** in this sense in the Bible, is to orient your life toward someone. As God’s people—those who are being saved—we are to play the part of the Prodigal Son who, though conscious of sin, guilt, and folly, flees to the Father (Luke 15:20). Paul at Lystra calls the people to turn to the living God (Acts 14:15). Paul refers to the Galatian Christians as those who had come to “know God” (Gal. 4:9); this is what we do in repentance: **we repent to, we turn to God**, and henceforth know him as the God who forgives our sins and accepts us for Christ’s sake.</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Turn away from sin.** Turning to God necessarily **implies our turning away from sin**. The whole Bible—OT and NT—clearly teaches that to repent is to “acknowledge [God’s] name and turn from [our] sins” (1 Kings 8:35; cf. 2 Chron. 7:14; Jer. 36:3; Ezek. 14:6; 18:30; Acts 3:19; 8:22; 26:18; Rev. 2:21–22; 9:20–21; 16:11). We cannot start to pursue God and sin at the same time. First John makes it clear that our basic way of life will either be oriented toward God and his light, or toward the darkness of sin. Christians in this life still sin, but against our deepest desires and better judgment; our lives are not guided and directed by sin as before. We are no longer enslaved to sin. Though we still struggle with it (Gal. 5:17), God has given us the gift of repentance (Acts 11:18), and we have been freed from sin’s dominating power.</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Believe and trust.** Put another way, our response is to believe and trust God’s promises in Christ, and to **commit ourselves to Christ**, the living Lord, as his **disciples**. Among **Jesus’ first words in Mark’s Gospel are “repent and believe in the gospel” (Mark 1:15)**. The obedience that typifies God’s people, beginning with repentance, is to result from the faith and trust we have in him and his word (e.g., Josh. 22:16; Acts 27:25). Thus sins are sometimes called “breaking faith with God” (e.g., Ezra 10:2, 10). Having faith in Christ, which seals our union with him through the Holy Spirit, is the means by which God accounts Christ’s righteousness as our own (Rom. 3:21–26; 5:17–21; Gal. 2:16; Eph. 2:8–9; Phil. 3:9). Paul could refer to “salvation through faith in Christ” (2 Tim. 3:15).</span>

>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">The need for repentance is highlighted in Jesus’ earliest preaching: “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel!” (Mark 1:15). Repentance is rooted in the human consciousness of sin, an awareness of falling short of a standard, relational brokenness and alienation, and fear of judgment. Whether motivated by inner guilt or shameful loss of face, repentance involves attitudes and acts that aim at setting things right. Coupled with confession, repentance is involved in the process of receiving forgiveness from God through Jesus Christ, and provides a model for person-to-person reconciliation as well.</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">From its beginning, the biblical narrative speaks of our need for repentance. Made in the image of God, and meant for fellowship with the Creator, Adam and Eve use their freedom to disobey a divine command (Gen 3). In estrangement they hide; when discovered, they attempt excuses in their fearfulness. At the origins of the human family, sin is present (hence the term “original sin”), which becomes part of the spiritual reality of all humanity. The result: “the person, the one sinning, will die” (Ezek 18:20). The sacrificial system of the Old Testament is established (in part) to address the necessity of atonement (Lev 17:11; Heb 9:22): “apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.”</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">Jewish tradition shows a lifelong struggle between the yetzer ha tov (good impulse) and the yetzer ha ra (evil impulse; compare Gen 4:7; Rom 7:22–23). The life of David dramatically demonstrates this. A man after God’s own heart, David nonetheless falls deeply into evil, committing adultery and murder (2 Sam 11). When David faces God’s justice and the consequences of sin, Psalm 51 presents his public response: a contrite heart, personal confession, and repentance (Psa 51:16–17). Later, Solomon received the promise that when God’s people humble themselves, pray, seek His face and turn from sin, God hears from heaven, forgives them, and heals their land (2 Chr 7:14).</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">The New Testament suggests several forms of turning to repentance and confession. First John 1:9 suggests personal confession of sin directly to God. Other passages invite the ministry of a friend, counselor, or minister to hear one’s confession (Matt 16:19; John 20:23; Jas 5:16). In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, the son’s repentant return is embraced by the parent’s unconditional love, bringing reconciliation (Luke 15:11–32). Jesus Himself teaches His disciples to pray “forgive us”—and this underlies general confession in corporate worship (Matt 6:12). The kyrie prayer, “Lord have mercy,” transcends cultural boundaries (Luke 18:13).</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">In the early church, initial repentance and forgiveness were closely identified with conversion and baptism (Acts 2:28). In addition to the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount, other exhortations about sin were emerging (Exod 20; Matt 5–7; compare 1 John 2:16; 3:4, Rom 14:23, Jas 4:17), which were accompanied by reflections on especially “deadly” sins (Mark 3:29; Acts 15:29; 1 John 5:16).</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">Hebrews emphasizes the ministry of Jesus as once-for-all sacrifice and abiding high priest (Heb 7:26–28; 9:11–15). The letter includes a fervent exhortation against backsliding from life in Christ (Heb 6:4–8; 10:26–31). Similarly, the book of Revelation proclaims the need for repentance for individual believers and entire church fellowships (Rev 1:4–3:22). Paul even speaks of “godly sorrow” that brings restoration, whereas “worldly sorrow”—guilt with no healthy remedy through grace—proves deadly (2 Cor 7:8–13).</span>

> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">... Now what was the sort of "hole" man had got himself into? He had tried to set up on his own, to behave as if he belonged to himself. In other words, fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: he is a rebel who must lay down his arms. Laying down your arms, surrendering, saying you are sorry, realising that you have been on the wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground floor—that is the only way out of a "hole." <span style="font-size:1.0em;font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">This process of surrender—this movement <span style="font-size:1.4em;color:#00cc44;">full speed astern</span>—is what Christians call repentance.</span> Now repentance is no fun at all.</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">It is something much harder than merely eating humble pie. It means unlearning all the self-conceit and self-will that we have been training ourselves into for thousands of years. It means killing part of yourself, undergoing a kind of death. In fact, it needs a good man to repent. And here comes the catch. Only a bad person needs to repent: only a good person can repent perfectly. The worse you are the more you need it and the less you can do it. The only person who could do it perfectly would be a perfect person—and he would not need it.</span>
>
> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">Remember, this repentance, this willing submission to humiliation and a kind of death, is not something God demands of you before He will take you back and which He could let you off if He chose: it is simply a description of what going back to Him is like. If you ask God to take you back without it, you are really asking Him to let you go back without going back. It cannot happen. Very well, then, we must go through with it. But the same badness which makes us need it, makes us unable to do it. Can we do it if God helps us? Yes, but what do we mean when we talk of God helping us? We mean God putting into us a bit of Himself, so to speak. He lends us a little of His reasoning powers and that is how we think: He puts a little of His love into us and that is how we love one another. When you teach a child writing, you hold its hand while it forms the letters: that is, it forms the letters because you are forming them. We love and reason because God loves and reasons and holds our hand while we do it.</span>

> <span style="font-size:0.8em;"> You can say that you are sorry for what you have done but if you continue to do it, that is not true repentance. **Real repentance is being so sorry, so contrite, that you do not do it again. You turn away from it and cease doing it.** If a person declares that they have repented of a certain action or sin, and they continue in that same action, there is good reason to doubt the genuineness of the repentance. It is not a true repentance when you continue in that sin. **Repentance is the first step to salvation.** &mdash; [**Chuck Smith**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/)
