There are those who would rather have soft nothings whispered into their ears by false teachers than hard truths by real ones (2Tim 4:3-4). Today that changes. I want you to see for yourself that Jesus, the Apostles, and other important figures in the Bible, were not afraid to speak the truth no matter who it offended (Lk 7:23 ESV).

# Jesus (God made manifest)

> The world can’t hate you, but it does hate me <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">because <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">I accuse it</span> of doing evil</span>. &mdash; **Jesus** in John 7:7 (cf. John 15:18-19)

--

> “If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">you are not worthy of being mine</span>.” — **Jesus** in Matthew 10:38 (cf. Luke 9:23 NET; Lk 14:27)

--

> “No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.” — Jesus in Luke 13:3 ESV
>> “Not at all! And you will perish, too, unless you repent of your sins and turn to God.” — Jesus in Luke 13:3 NLT (Parallel)

> 34 “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 36 And a person's enemies will be those of his own household. 37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 38 And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. — Jesus in Matthew 10:34-40

> 14 Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, “Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.” 16 So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the earth was reaped. — Jesus in Revelation by the Apostle John 14:14-16 ESV

> “He is clothed with a robe <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Crimson;">dipped in blood</span>, and His name is called The Word of God.” — Jesus in Revelation 19:13 NASB '95

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">9</sup> And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, <sup style="font-weight:bold">10</sup> **he also** will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold">11</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night</span>, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.” &mdash; Revelation 14:9-11 ESV

# The Apostle Peter

> Second Pet 2:1 describes “false prophets” who “secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Sovereign Lord who bought them.” These persons professed to be Christians and were influential teachers of the church. **Peter’s elaboration of them as “brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed” (v. 12), “springs without water and mists driven by a storm” (v. 17), and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Red;">“slaves of depravity” (v. 2Pe 2:19 LEB)</span> shows that the subjects were unregenerate professors of the faith.** The end of their apostasy is described as “swift destruction” (cf. v. 12b, 17b). &mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest (Ph.D., University of Manchester), The Cross and Salvation, Chapter Eleven, III. Exposition of the Doctrine of Preservation,  D. Some Apostatize Because Unconverted. p. 457.

<!-- # The Apostle Matthew -->


<!-- # A Shepherd Drives The Sheep

Today I will drive the sheep to greener pastures. Some people would rather have soft nothings whispered into their ears by false teachers than hard truths by real ones. Today that changes.

> “The words of the wise are like cattle prods—**painful but helpful**. Their collected sayings are like a nail-studded stick with which <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">a shepherd drives the sheep</span>.” ― Ecclesiastes 12:11

# If You Hate Me For This You Actually Hate Christ

No one is hated more than he who speaks the truth. If you love this message of correction and reproof the Bible calls you a wise man, if not a fool (Proverbs 9:8).

> The world can’t hate you, but it does hate me <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">because I accuse it of doing evil</span>. &mdash; **Jesus** in John 7:7

> “If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first. The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it, but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world, so it hates you. &mdash; John 15:18-19

# Take Up Your Cross

Genuine saving faith results in obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10) and good works that follow after justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience. Christianity is a call to discipleship.

> “If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">you are not worthy of being mine</span>.” — Jesus in Matthew 10:38

> Then he said to them all, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">daily</span>, and follow me. &mdash; Luke 9:23 NET

# Repent or Perish

Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ (Acts 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8). Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).

> “No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.” — Jesus in Luke 13:3 ESV
>> “Not at all! And you will perish, too, unless you repent of your sins and turn to God.” — Jesus in Luke 13:3 NLT (Parallel)

Justification is by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified. True Christians don't make a "practice" of sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62). Sanctification is progressive and worked by the Holy Spirit, it is not regressive, it is not sedentary.

> Then he said, “I tell you the truth, unless you turn from your sins and become like little children, you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven. &mdash; Matthew 18:3

# Conclusion

If you are unrepentant (Lk 13:3) and you pursue lifestyles of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Gal 5:19-21) **the only assurance you have, is no assurance**. You need to wake up. You should be told to test to see if your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), to see if you really are trusting in Christ, because if you were, you'd be repentant, you'd carry your cross daily (Mt 10:38; Lk 9:23), you'd be bearing the fruits of obedience (John 15:1-17; James 2:14-26; Jn 14:15; 1 Jn 2:4), and you'd have the assurance of being foreknown (Mt 22:14). These are divine enablements. -->
