After a considerable amount of time and [**thought**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) considering the following theologies, soteriologies:

- Theologies
    - 🟡 [Amyraldism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) &mdash; May be a viable option, still [reviewing](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/election/).
    - 🟡 [Moderate Arminianism]() &mdash; May be a viable option, still [reviewing](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/election/).
    - 🟡 [Lutheranism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-lutheran/) &mdash; doesn't believe in eternal security.
    - 🟠 [Calvinism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed//) &mdash; While [monergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/monergism/), St. Augustine, Luther, & Calvin all rejected “Limited Atonement” (1Jn 2:2 NET). 
    - 🟠 [Arminianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-arminian/) &mdash; Arminians are thrice [synergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/synergism/). They view regeneration, sanctification, and perseverance as a synergistic activity.
    - 🔴 [Catholicism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-roman-catholicism/) &mdash; Legalistic in the way of [sacerdotalism](https://carm.org/dictionary/sacerdotalism/).
- Soteriologies
    - 🟢 [**Sola Fide**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/) &mdash; The original 500+ year old lordship position. Five Solas are solid.
    - 🟠 [Lordship Salvation]() &mdash; Sometimes confuses the word "results" with "includes," when considering obedience and works, erroneously altering sola fide, and moving far too close to a legalistic stance.
    - 🔴 ['80s Free Grace](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repent/) &mdash; Rejects sound scholarship, lexicon definitions, and academic community on meaning of [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/) holding to category mistake, alters reformation doctrine of [faith alone](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/), doesn't know it's own [founder's](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#ryrie_cite) beliefs. Sometimes teaches intellectual assent to facts, which is against scripture.
- As well as the following [**criteria**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/):
    - 🟢 Verses against legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
    - 🟢 Verses against antinomianism (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62)
    - 🟢 Verses for obedience after salvation (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4)
    - 🟢 Verses for Godly dispositions of Love (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35)
    - 🟢 Verses for Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; Gal 5:22-23)
    - 🟢 Verses for good works after salvation (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)

I believe a moderate position is the best representative of the Bible. I identify as a Historic Protestant. As a Historic Protestant, I can read literature from both Lutherans, Calvinists, Arminians, etc, without accepting all of their distinctives. I am also on the side of [the most brilliant thinkers in theology and science throughout history](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/science/), as well as being sided with the most robust theological history and support from the early church.
