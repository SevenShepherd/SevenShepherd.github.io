<!-- SevenShepherd was originally a nickname to denote a perfect or ideal Shepherd, of course I had Christ in mind. The epithet "Unseen Shepherd" used for this article, plays into the fact that I don't desire to reveal who I am, I simply wish to share the truth with others.  -->

After reviewing nearly all theologies for the past five-hundred years, I decided to create my own by taking only the most logical and sound aspects from each. I will attempt to construct my own theology in this article over time.

<a name="deduce" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.1 Deducing The Correct Answer</a>

- Q1. Do you believe in the devil? 
    - A1. Every Christian would respond: yes.
- Q2. Do you believe in God?
    - A2. Every Christian would respond: yes.
- Q3. Does believing in the devil make you a satanist?
    - A3. Every Christian would respond: no.
- Q4. Does believing in God make you a Christian?
    - A4. This is where confusion arises.

<!--  -->

Let's define what "Belief in" actually means.

- Q5.  The story goes something like this (based on true events): A witch astral projects to harm a Christian family, she's prevented from doing so because there are angels surrounding and protecting the family's home, clearly this witch believes in God and angels, is she saved?
    - A5. The answer is obviously no, because there is no "belief in," "faith in," "trust in," "reliance on," "approval of" God, only intellectual assent to facts. So while there may be notitia and assensus, there is no fiducia.

<!--  -->

I think [Packer](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#packer) describes this best when he delineates that saving faith is composed of three essential elements: notitia, assensus, and fiducia. "Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14)."

- The latin term notitia means 'knowledge' and refers to an "acquaintance with the content of the gospel"
- Assensus or ‘agreement’ means "recognition that the gospel is true"
- Fiducia means ‘trust and reliance’ and it speaks of the "personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one’s own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3." 

**This is the historic protestant understanding and teaching of faith and I believe this is the correct conclusion.**

<!-- > Reformed theology analysed faith as notitia (‘knowledge’, i.e. acquaintance with the content of the gospel), plus assensus (‘agreement’, i.e. recognition that the gospel is true), plus fiducia (‘trust and reliance’, i.e. personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one’s own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3). Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14). &mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford) -->

<!-- One does not need to be reformed to be a historic protestant, any more than he has to be a 5-point Calvinist in order to be reformed. The first phase of the reformation was amyraldian (moderate). -->

<a name="lexicons" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.2 Lexicons & Dictionaries</a>

The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (**TDNT "Kittel"**) defines the underlying greek word **pisteúō**: 

> 4\. pisteúō means **&ldquo;to trust&rdquo; (also &ldquo;to obey&rdquo;)**, &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; (words), and in the passive &ldquo;to enjoy confidence&rdquo; (cf. the later sense &ldquo;to confide in&rdquo;).

We can also double check with the Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (**BDAG**), **the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon**. We can see that John 3:16 falls under the second meaning described below:

> **2 to entrust oneself to an entity in complete confidence, believe (in), trust,** w. implication of total commitment to the one who is trusted. In our lit. God and Christ are objects of this type of faith that relies on their power and nearness to help, in addition to being convinced that their revelations or disclosures are true.

<!-- A quick glance at [**Mounce**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#mounce) reveals the following:

> An accurate understanding of the use of metanoeo and metanoia in the NT is essential to grasp the gospel message, because **it does not allow for someone to obtain salvation simply by intellectually believing that Jesus is the Son of God without repenting of sins and turning to live for him.** See NIDNTT-A,367. -->

<a name="james2:19" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.3 Teachings Of The Apostle James</a>

James points out that *intellectual assent to facts* is a type of belief that [**even a demon can exercise**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#carson). Colloquially: you believe in God? Whoop-dee-doo, even the demons can exercise that kind of faith, but they aren't saved! Where's your "trust in," "reliance on," God? Where's your fiducia?

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> You say you have faith, for you believe that **there is one God**.<span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[a]</span> Good for you! Even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. &mdash; James 2:19 NLT

I think [Grudem](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#grudem) describes this best when he delineates James teaching:

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus’ life and saving works, for James says, “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!” (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. — Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge), Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. pp. 861-862.

Here is some logic to consider:

<!-- Jn 6:29; Phil 1:29; -->

1. James 2:19 states that demons are believers.
2. James 2:26 equates this kind of belief (assent) with a dead or superficial faith.
3. Christians then are to have a living/saving faith (fiducia and &ldquo;resulting&rdquo; obedience).
4. Demons therefore have a "dead faith," the kind we're not supposed to have.
5. If demons cannot repent, and repentance is granted (Ac 11:18; 2Ti 2:25), then they're by definition unrepentant as well.
6. A dead faith is a faith that even a demon can exercise.
7. A living faith is a faith only the elect can exercise (Jn 6:29; Phil 1:29)

The elect are believers. This statement takes no stance on the conditionality or unconditionality of election in this section.

<a name="OrdoSalutis" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">⚜️ 3. Ordo Salutis</a>

Ordo salutis is a latin phrase for “The Order of Salvation” and was first coined by Lutheran theologians Franz Buddeus and Jacob Carpov in the first half of the eighteenth century.

<!-- - <a name="election" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.1 Predestination</a>

    [Foreknowledge](/assets/images/greek/proginosko.png)

    Without regard for foreseen human faith or good works, God in eternity past chose from among the lot of fallen humanity some to inherit eternal life. -->

<!-- - <a name="election" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 Effectual calling</a>

    The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.

3. **Belief in the Gospel**
    - Quickened by the Spirit, the minds of the elect are persuaded of the truths of the Gospel of God’s grace.
4. **Repentance**
    - Likewise enabled by the Spirit the effectually called despise and turn away from all known sins.
5. **Trust in Christ**
    - The effectually called personally commit themselves to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their life.
6. **Regeneration**
    - God creates in justified believers new life, defined as the radical reorientation of the dispositions and affections toward God.
7. **Union with Christ**
    - The Spirit unites newly born saints with Jesus Christ in a vital, spiritual, and indissoluble union. The NT describes this experiential reality by the familiar “in Christ” motif.
8. **Justification**
    - God in turn reckons believing sinners righteous in his sight and bestows upon them the gift of eternal life.
9. **Sanctification**
    - By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.
10. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - By the application of divine power, God faithfully preserves regenerate saints in faith and hope unto the attainment of eternal life.
11. **Glorification**
    - God perfects the final and complete redemption of the believer—body, soul, and spirit—at the Parousia of the Lord Jesus Christ.  -->
