After a considerable amount of time and [thought](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-christian-walk/) considering the following theologies:

- [Amyraldism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/)
- [Calvinism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed//)
- [Lutheranism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-lutheran/)
- [Arminianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-arminian/)
- [Roman Catholicism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-roman-catholicism/)

As well as the following [criteria](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-christian-walk/):

- Verses against legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
- Verses against antinomianism (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62)
- Verses for obedience after salvation (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4)
- Verses for Godly dispositions of Love (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35)
- Verses for Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; Gal 5:22-23)
- Verses for good works after salvation (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)

I believe a [moderate form of reformed theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) is the best representative of the Bible. I now identify as a Historic Protestant. As a Historic Protestant, I can read literature from both Calvinists and Arminians, without accepting their distinctives. I am also on the side of [the most brilliant thinkers in theology and science throughout history](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/science/), as well as being sided with the most robust theological history and support from the early church.
