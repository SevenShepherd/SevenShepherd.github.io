<!-- SevenShepherd was originally a nickname to denote a perfect or ideal Shepherd, of course I had Christ in mind. The epithet "Unseen Shepherd" used for this article, plays into the fact that I don't desire to reveal who I am, I simply wish to share the truth with others.  -->

After reviewing nearly all theologies for the past five-hundred years, I decided to create my own by taking only the most logical and sound aspects from each. I will attempt to construct my own theology in this article over time.

<a name="deduce" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.1 Deducing The Correct Answer</a>

- Q1. Do you believe in the devil? 
    - A1. Every Christian would respond: yes.
- Q2. Do you believe in God?
    - A2. Every Christian would respond: yes.
- Q3. Does believing in the devil make you a satanist?
    - A3. Every Christian would respond: no.
- Q4. Does believing in God make you a Christian?
    - A4. This is where confusion arises.

<!--  -->

Let's define what "Belief in" actually means.

- Q5.  The story goes something like this (based on true events): A witch astral projects to harm a Christian family, she's prevented from doing so because there are angels surrounding and protecting the family's home, clearly this witch believes in God and angels, is she saved?
    - A5. The answer is obviously no, because there is no "belief in," "faith in," "trust in," "reliance on," "approval of" God, only intellectual assent to facts. So while there may be notitia and assensus, there is no fiducia.

<!--  -->

I think [Packer](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#packer) describes this best when he delineates that saving faith is composed of three essential elements: notitia, assensus, and fiducia. "Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14)."

- The latin term notitia means 'knowledge' and refers to an "acquaintance with the content of the gospel"
- Assensus or ‘agreement’ means "recognition that the gospel is true"
- Fiducia means ‘trust and reliance’ and it speaks of the "personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one’s own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3." 

**This is the historic protestant understanding and teaching of faith and I believe this is the correct conclusion.**

<!-- > Reformed theology analysed faith as notitia (‘knowledge’, i.e. acquaintance with the content of the gospel), plus assensus (‘agreement’, i.e. recognition that the gospel is true), plus fiducia (‘trust and reliance’, i.e. personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one’s own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3). Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14). &mdash; Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford) -->

<!-- One does not need to be reformed to be a historic protestant, any more than he has to be a 5-point Calvinist in order to be reformed. The first phase of the reformation was amyraldian (moderate). -->

<a name="lexicons" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.2 Lexicons & Dictionaries</a>

The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (**TDNT "Kittel"**) defines the underlying greek word **pisteúō**: 

> 4\. pisteúō means **&ldquo;to trust&rdquo; (also &ldquo;to obey&rdquo;)**, &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; (words), and in the passive &ldquo;to enjoy confidence&rdquo; (cf. the later sense &ldquo;to confide in&rdquo;).

We can also double check with the Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (**BDAG**), **the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon**. We can see that John 3:16 falls under the second meaning described below:

> **2 to entrust oneself to an entity in complete confidence, believe (in), trust,** w. implication of total commitment to the one who is trusted. In our lit. God and Christ are objects of this type of faith that relies on their power and nearness to help, in addition to being convinced that their revelations or disclosures are true.

<!-- A quick glance at [**Mounce**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#mounce) reveals the following:

> An accurate understanding of the use of metanoeo and metanoia in the NT is essential to grasp the gospel message, because **it does not allow for someone to obtain salvation simply by intellectually believing that Jesus is the Son of God without repenting of sins and turning to live for him.** See NIDNTT-A,367. -->

<a name="james2:19" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.1.3 Teachings Of The Apostle James</a>

James points out that *intellectual assent to facts* is a type of belief that [**even a demon can exercise**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#carson). Colloquially: you believe in God? Whoop-dee-doo, even the demons can exercise that kind of faith, but they aren't saved! Where's your "trust in," "reliance on," God? Where's your fiducia?

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> You say you have faith, for you believe that **there is one God**.<span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[a]</span> Good for you! Even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. &mdash; James 2:19 NLT

I think [Grudem](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#grudem) describes this best when he delineates James teaching:

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus’ life and saving works, for James says, “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!” (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. — Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge), Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. pp. 861-862.

Here is some logic to consider:

<!-- Jn 6:29; Phil 1:29; -->

1. James 2:19 states that demons are believers.
2. James 2:26 equates this kind of belief (assent) with a dead or superficial faith.
3. Christians then are to have a living/saving faith (fiducia and &ldquo;resulting&rdquo; obedience).
4. Demons therefore have a "dead faith," the kind we're not supposed to have.
5. If demons cannot repent, and repentance is granted (Ac 11:18; 2Ti 2:25), then they're by definition unrepentant as well.
6. A dead faith is a faith that even a demon can exercise.
7. A living faith is a faith only the elect can exercise (Jn 6:29; Phil 1:29)

The elect are believers. This statement takes no stance on the conditionality or unconditionality of election in this section.

<a name="saving" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.2 Saving Faith Is Salvific</a>

**I dedicated an entire [article](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) to this topic. Please [read](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) it.**

<a name="alone" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.1 By Grace Through Faith Alone</a>

Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). [Sola fide](/assets/images/solas.jpg). 

<!-- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God and good works that "follow after" justification. -->

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me**. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.” &mdash; John 14:21 NLT (cf. Jn 14:15).

While works definitely **do not** save us, they do spring forth from a true and lively faith.

- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
- Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
- The practice of unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (1 Cor. 5:12-13; Luke 17:3-4)
- Those who practice lifelong habitual sin are likely self-deceived (James 1:22; 2 Pe 2:21-22) and will not inherit the kingdom of God (Mt 18:3; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5 ... + Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32)
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (Mt 10:38; 16:24; Lk 9:23,62; 14:27; Mk 8:34... Mt 3:10; 25:30; Jn 15:8 ESV)
- True Christians love God by obeying him (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4).
- True Christians love other believers (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10,14; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
- The Bible teaches us to live Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; 2 Pe 2:21-22).
- The teaching of obedience to God after justification is not burdensome, in fact it's a reason for joy (1 Jn 5:3-4; Jn 15:10-11).

These quotations make clear that this teaching is sound, neither legalistic, nor antinomian.

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)

> **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.** Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‘faith apart from observing the law’, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">if ‘good works’ (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith</span>, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">justifying faith (fiducia) is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not yet ours</span></span>. &mdash; [Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford), Concise Theology. Chapter 59 Works. p. 174.](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo)

<a name="repentance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.2 Repentance Is An Immediate Fruit Of Genuine Saving Faith</a>

Repentance an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith, and is defined as a turning away from sin to God that leads to salvation and eternal life. Unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (2Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18; Acts 26:15-20; Acts 3:19; Luke 17:3-4; 1Cor. 5:12-13)

- Repentance is **a turning away from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is **a Godly sorrow** that **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance is necessary (Lk 13:3) **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5)

<a name="living" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.3 Living Faith v. Dead Faith</a>

James rejects salvation by dead faith (James 2:14-26). Put another way, James rejects salvation by superficial faith, because faith is the instrument on which we lay hold of grace. Paul tells us to test for genuine faith, or a living faith, because Christ lives in you (2 Cor. 13:5).

<!-- There are two verses in the Bible that talk about the difference between a dead faith and a living faith. The first such instance is in James 2:14-26 where James implies that a *dead faith* is not the kind of faith that saves.  -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if **someone** says he has faith but does not have works? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Can that faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">save him</span>?</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> So also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">faith by itself, if it does not have works, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:14-17 ESV

James goes on to say that *intellectual assent to facts* is a type of belief that **even a demon can exercise**. We can conclude that if it's not a dead faith that saves, then the faith that justifies is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive, and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus’ life and saving works, for James says, “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!” (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. — Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge), Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. pp. 861-862.

We can also draw this same conclusion from second corinthians. We can see that the Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

> Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test! &mdash; 2 Corinthians 13:5

The reason I have spent the time explaining the difference between a dead faith and a living faith is to describe how people fall into the heresy of antinomianism. It would seem there is a growing concern over this form of false assurance; there are actually teachers out there who violate the message of the Apostles (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62), falsely teaching that God's grace allows us to live immoral lives, which the Bible does not support in any way, shape, or form.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you—men who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe—<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">ungodly men</span> who have turned the grace of our God into a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">license for evil</span></span> and who <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">deny our only <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Master and Lord</span>, Jesus Christ</span>. &mdash; Jude 1:4 NET

It's true that we are saved by grace and faith alone (Eph 2:8-10), but it's also true that saving faith results in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that follow after justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).

When you profess Christ truly, you walk as he walked. We're not saved by this walk, but that's what happens as a result of a genuine profession of faith. The answer to all of these questions should be: Yes!

1. Are you saved according to Eph. 2:8-10?
2. Do you love God according to John 14:15,21?
3. Do you see the fruits (Gal. 5:22-23) and evidences (James 2:14-26) of a true and lively faith?

<!-- We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only have you proven that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but that your profession of faith was false (1Jn 2:3-6).  -->

We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only are you showing evidence that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but you're also showing evidence that your profession of faith is false (1Jn 2:3-6). 

> **Biblical faith is evidence-based.**... **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing. ... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*. p. 136, 218, 313.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#lennox)

<a name="sanctify" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.3 Progressive Sanctification</a>

Christians undergo a progressive sanctification of decreasing patterns of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Ro 6:1-2,15). While the scriptures teach that a living or saving faith &ldquo;results&rdquo; in obedience to God, it does not teach that it &ldquo;includes&rdquo; obedience, nor does it teach perfectionism. Obedience is only seen as a fruit of genuine saving faith, and only as an evidence not a proof.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> What shall we say then? **Are we to remain in sin** so that grace may increase? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> **Absolutely not!** How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> What then? **Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!** &mdash; Romans 6:1-2,15 NET

<!-- <a name="repentance" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">2.2.2 Repentance Is An Immediate Fruit Of Genuine Saving Faith</a> -->

These verses prove that Christians do not pursue lifestyles of indulgent sin. We are not under the law, we are under grace, yet we still do not make a practice of sinning.

1. We're not under the law (Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. We're under grace (Eph 2:8-10)
3. We still don't make a "practice" of sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> For those whom he **foreknew** he also **predestined** to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> And those whom he predestined he also **called**, and those whom he called he also **justified**, and those whom he justified he also **glorified**. &mdash; Romans 8:29-30 ESV

<!-- Without regard for foreseen human faith or good works, God in eternity past chose from among the lot of fallen humanity some to inherit eternal life. -->

<!-- - <a name="election" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 Effectual calling</a>

    The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.

3. **Belief in the Gospel**
    - Quickened by the Spirit, the minds of the elect are persuaded of the truths of the Gospel of God’s grace.
4. **Repentance**
    - Likewise enabled by the Spirit the effectually called despise and turn away from all known sins.
5. **Trust in Christ**
    - The effectually called personally commit themselves to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their life.
6. **Regeneration**
    - God creates in justified believers new life, defined as the radical reorientation of the dispositions and affections toward God.
7. **Union with Christ**
    - The Spirit unites newly born saints with Jesus Christ in a vital, spiritual, and indissoluble union. The NT describes this experiential reality by the familiar “in Christ” motif.
8. **Justification**
    - God in turn reckons believing sinners righteous in his sight and bestows upon them the gift of eternal life.
9. **Sanctification**
    - By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.
10. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - By the application of divine power, God faithfully preserves regenerate saints in faith and hope unto the attainment of eternal life.
11. **Glorification**
    - God perfects the final and complete redemption of the believer—body, soul, and spirit—at the Parousia of the Lord Jesus Christ.  -->
