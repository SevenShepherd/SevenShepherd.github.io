<!-- Chuck Smith Was Right To Teach That Repentance Is Sorrow, Contrition, And A Turning Away From Sin As Every Authoritative Greek Lexicon Shows. -->

As I will prove below, Chuck Smith knew what he was talking about. If you have a teacher that doesn't teach repentance correctly, get rid of them quickly because it is highly likely that they are false teachers. Chuck Smith taught on this topic correctly.

> You can say that you are sorry for what you have done but if you continue to do it, that is not true repentance. **Real repentance is being so sorry, so contrite, that you do not do it again. You turn away from it and cease doing it.** If a person declares that they have repented of a certain action or sin, and they continue in that same action, there is good reason to doubt the genuineness of the repentance. It is not a true repentance when you continue in that sin. **Repentance is the first step to salvation.** &mdash; [**Chuck Smith**](https://youtu.be/kP8rIIps4Sk?t=130)

[**A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd ed. (BDAG).**](https://amzn.to/3I4m4ES) This Lexicon is the world's most authoritative Greek lexicon. You'll find the proof needed below that all instances of the Greek words for repentance fall under the second meaning of "feel remorse, repent, be converted" (in religio-ethical sense). This specific cite is specific to entries [metano√©≈ç (567)](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [met√°noia (567-568)](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png). The scans were pulled from the 4th ed.

<a name="TDNT" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.2 Theological Dictionary of the New Testament (TDNT)</a>

Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (TDNT) is one of the world‚Äôs most authoritative Greek Lexicon‚Äôs. This lexicon is repeatedly taken out of context by false teachers on the word repentance. For instance, when they give the secular/pagan Greek meaning instead of the meanings applied to OT and NT contexts. Here is the correct context within TDNT. pp. 574-575.

> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">E. metano√©≈ç and met√°noia in the NT.</span><br><br>
>**1. The Linguistic Understanding.** The two words are most common in the Synoptics and Acts (the verb 21 times, the noun 14). Paul has the verb only once, and the noun four times. The verb occurs 12 times in Revelation, the noun three times in Hebrews and once in 2 Peter. The popular sense occurs in Lk. 17:3-4 and 2 Cor. 7:9-10 (‚Äïregret‚Äñ or ‚Äïremorse‚Äñ). The usual meaning is ‚Äïchange of mind‚Äñ or ‚Äïconversion‚Äñ with the full OT nuance. This nuance is important, for it makes a big difference whether the call of Jesus to repent is a call to total conversion or simply a call to sorrow for sin, a change of mind, or acts of restitution.
>
>**2. The Concept of Conversion.**<br>
>>**(1) John the Baptist.** Conversion is the core of the message of John, who proclaims the imminence of judgment and demands a turning to God as God is turning to us. The summons acquires new urgency inasmuch as it stands in the light of eschatological revelation. This is a once-for-all conversion, an inner change, that is required even of the righteous and must find expression in acts of love. A baptism of conversion signifies that God is at work to change our nature for the new aeon. God himself grants conversion as both gift and task; it is for us to let it be given and to authenticate it as the divine basis of a new being.
>
>>**(2) Jesus.** In the teaching of Jesus metanoe√≠te is the imperative that is implied in the indicative of the message of the kingdom. Conversion is a basic requirement that follows from the reality of the eschatological kingdom as it is present in Jesus' person. The preaching and miracles are a call to conversion in a final and unconditional decision, in a once-for-all turning to God in total obedience (cf. Mk. 1:15; Mt. 12:39ff.; 11:20ff.; Mt. 4:17). This is the point of Jesus‚Äò teaching even when the terms are not used. Not merely evil, but anything that might be put before God must be renounced (Mt. 5:29-30; 10:32ff., etc.). Conversion applies to all people, demanding a complete commitment that seeks forgiveness in full trust and surrender. Faith is its positive aspect (cf. Mk. 1:15). It is not a human achievement, for it involves becoming small and receptive like a child (Mt. 18:3). It is God‚Äòs gift, but as such a binding requirement. By the baptism of the Spirit Jesus imparts the divine power that creates those who are subject to the divine rule, i.e., converted people. In all its severity, then, the message is one of joy. met√°noia is not law, but gospel.
>
>>**(3) Primitive Christianity.**<br>
>>
>>>**a. General.** In the apostolic kerygma conversion is a total requirement. The disciples preach it in Mk. 6:12 and are directed to summon people to it in Lk. 24:47. met√°noia is at the heart of their message in Acts (5:31; 8:22; 11:18, etc.). It is a basic article in Heb. 6:1. Peter‚Äòs sermon connects it with baptism (Acts 2:38). It is a turning from evil to God (8:22; 20:21). It is both a divine gift and a human task (5:31; 2:38). It embraces all life (cf. Acts 3:19 etc.). Its basis is Christ‚Äòs saving work (5:31). The Spirit effects it (11:18). Faith goes with it (26:18). The imminent end gives urgency to its proclamation (Rev. 2:5, 16; 3:3). The goal is remission of sins (Acts 3:19) and final salvation (11:18).<br>
>>
>>>**b. Paul.** In Rom. 2:4 met√°noia in view of the judgment is what God in his goodness seeks for us. It is God‚Äòs gift (2 Tim. 2:25). It means a radical break with the past (2 Cor. 12:21). Psychologically it involves remorse (2 Cor. 7:9-10), but more deeply it is God‚Äòs saving work. For Paul, the concept of faith embraces conversion with its implication of death and renewal. This explains his sparing use of the terms.<br>
>>
>>>**c. John.** In John, too, faith includes conversion. So does the new birth from God. The sharp line drawn between light and darkness etc. means that believing in God necessarily carries with it a turning from evil.<br>
>>
>>>**d. The Impossibility of a Second metano√≠a in Hebrews.** Hebrews stresses the total seriousness of conversion. We cannot command it at will (12:7). There is no renewal of it for apostates. What is at issue is not daily repentance but the decisive change that is a new creation. Those who are set in the circle of eschatological salvation, if they consciously arrest the movement and turn back from God, are exposed to eschatological judgment. Conversion is a totality, and hence its surrender is a total surrender.

<a name="amg-concise" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.1 AMG Concise Bible Dictionary</a>

[AMG Concise Bible Dictionary](https://amzn.to/42jh1ZK) has done the word Repentance justice more than any other Bible dictionary that I've ever seen. I am beside myself with how accurate this is while remaining readable, and non-technical.

> **Repentance is a turning from sin to God** (Deut 30:1-2; 2 Chron 6:26-27; 7:14; Neh 1:9; Ps 78:34; Isa 55:7; Jer 8:6; 31:18-19; Ezek 18:21; Mal 3:7; Matt 11:20-21; Luke 15:7; 16:30; Acts 3:19; 8:22; 14:15; 26:19-20; Rev 9:20-21). The open demonstration of this turning to God is sometimes **called conversion** (Acts 15:3; cf. 26:17-18; 1 Thess 1:9-10). Jesus and New Testament preachers commanded people to repent, because **without repentance there can be no salvation** (Matt 3:2; 4:17; Mark 6:12; Luke 5:32; 13:3; 24:47; Acts 2:38; 11:18; 17:30).
>
It is true that faith is the means by which people receive salvation (Rom 3:22-25; Eph 2:8), but **faith that does not involve repentance is not true faith**. It is not a faith that leads to salvation. Faith means complete trust in Jesus Christ and his atoning death. It means that a person has total dependance on Christ for his entire salvation (see FAITH). But such trust is impossible so long as a person still clings to anything of himself. He cannot rely upon the work of Christ for the forgiveness of sin unless he turns from that sin (Mark 1:15; Acts 11:21; 20:21; 26:18; 1 Thess 1:9).
>
Because faith involves repentance and repentance involves faith, the Bible in some places speaks of forgiveness as depending on faith (Acts 10:43; 13:38-39), in others as depending on repentance (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26). But the preaching of repentance to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:46-47).
>
While it is true that people must exercise faith and repentance if they are to be saved, it is also true that neither faith nor repentance would be possible in the heart of self-centered man apart from the gracious work of God. God is the one who brings conviction of sin within people and gives them the readiness to repent and believe (Acts 5:31; 11:18; cf. John 6:65; 16:7-11).
> Repentance involves a complete change in the mind and will of the believer. It is more then mere sorrow for sin; it is surrender to God. A person may be sorry for his sin because of its consequences but still have no thought for God. **True repentance recognizes the character of sin as deserving God's judgement, and turns from that sin to ask God's forgiveness.** Sorrow for sin that ignores God leads only to self-pity and despair. Godly sorrow leads to repentance and new life (2 Cor 7:9-10; cf. Job 42:5-6; Ps 51:1-17; Luke 18:13). **It proves its genuineness in a complete change of behavior** (Luke 3:8-14; 19:8; 2 Cor 5:17; 1 John 2:4-6).

> **Redemption**<br>The best-known verse in the Bible summarizes the required response to this good news: ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life‚Äù (John 3:16). **To ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù Jesus includes both a wholehearted trust in him for forgiveness of sins and a decision to forsake one‚Äôs sin or to ‚Äúrepent‚Äù: All who truly ‚Äúrepent [or turn from their sins] and believe [in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins]‚Äù will be redeemed (Mark 1:15) and restored to a right relationship with God.** To ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù Jesus also requires relating to, and putting trust in, Jesus as he truly is‚Äînot just a man in ancient history but also a living Savior today who knows our hearts and hears our prayers. &mdash; God's Plan of Salvation, Redemption.

> **Response**<br>
So if God has done this in Christ, what are we to do to be saved? **We must turn to God in Christ**, which entails **turning back from sin**. If we repent of (**decide to forsake and turn from**) our sin (as best we understand it) and **trust in Christ as a living person**, we will be saved from God‚Äôs righteous wrath against our sins. ...
>
> **Turn to God.** In the OT, God commands people to turn or return to him, and so be saved (e.g., Isa. 6:10; Jer. 18:8). In the NT, **Christ preached that people should turn to God**, and Paul summarized his account of his preaching with that phrase: ‚Äúthat they [everyone] should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance‚Äù (Acts 26:20; cf. Acts 26:18). Thus, as Paul said earlier, he preached ‚Äútestifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ‚Äù (Acts 20:21). **To repent means to turn. And the turning that we are called to do in order to be saved is fundamentally a turning to God.** James could refer to the Gentiles who **‚Äúturn to God‚Äù** (Acts 15:19). To **‚Äúturn to,‚Äù** in this sense in the Bible, is to orient your life toward someone. As God‚Äôs people‚Äîthose who are being saved‚Äîwe are to play the part of the Prodigal Son who, though conscious of sin, guilt, and folly, flees to the Father (Luke 15:20). Paul at Lystra calls the people to turn to the living God (Acts 14:15). Paul refers to the Galatian Christians as those who had come to ‚Äúknow God‚Äù (Gal. 4:9); this is what we do in repentance: **we repent to, we turn to God**, and henceforth know him as the God who forgives our sins and accepts us for Christ‚Äôs sake.
>
> **Turn away from sin.** Turning to God necessarily **implies our turning away from sin**. The whole Bible‚ÄîOT and NT‚Äîclearly teaches that to repent is to ‚Äúacknowledge [God‚Äôs] name and turn from [our] sins‚Äù (1 Kings 8:35; cf. 2 Chron. 7:14; Jer. 36:3; Ezek. 14:6; 18:30; Acts 3:19; 8:22; 26:18; Rev. 2:21‚Äì22; 9:20‚Äì21; 16:11). We cannot start to pursue God and sin at the same time. First John makes it clear that our basic way of life will either be oriented toward God and his light, or toward the darkness of sin. Christians in this life still sin, but against our deepest desires and better judgment; our lives are not guided and directed by sin as before. We are no longer enslaved to sin. Though we still struggle with it (Gal. 5:17), God has given us the gift of repentance (Acts 11:18), and we have been freed from sin‚Äôs dominating power.
>
> **Believe and trust.** Put another way, our response is to believe and trust God‚Äôs promises in Christ, and to **commit ourselves to Christ**, the living Lord, as his **disciples**. Among **Jesus‚Äô first words in Mark‚Äôs Gospel are ‚Äúrepent and believe in the gospel‚Äù (Mark 1:15)**. The obedience that typifies God‚Äôs people, beginning with repentance, is to result from the faith and trust we have in him and his word (e.g., Josh. 22:16; Acts 27:25). Thus sins are sometimes called ‚Äúbreaking faith with God‚Äù (e.g., Ezra 10:2, 10). Having faith in Christ, which seals our union with him through the Holy Spirit, is the means by which God accounts Christ‚Äôs righteousness as our own (Rom. 3:21‚Äì26; 5:17‚Äì21; Gal. 2:16; Eph. 2:8‚Äì9; Phil. 3:9). Paul could refer to ‚Äúsalvation through faith in Christ‚Äù (2 Tim. 3:15).
