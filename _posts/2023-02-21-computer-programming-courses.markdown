<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;color:Black;">Hello and welcome,</span>

my name is Ryan and my philosophy is known as autodidacticism. I have been a programmer since the turn of the millennium. In the past, I successfully taught myself how to program in C/C++, grew advanced with Perl, but ultimately my formal language of choice became Python, and as a result, the predominant paradigm you‚Äôll see me implement in this blog is of the imperative rather than declarative variety.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. &mdash; Matthew 5:16 KJV

In 2016 I created a custom programmed and automated Twitter based Christian ministry at [@SevenShepherd](https://twitter.com/SevenShepherd) that has been running successfully ever since, from a custom built raspberry pi single-board computer. From 2016 to the January 2023, this ministry has posted over 2,639,234 tweets, and received more than 7,597,960 likes & retweets. This is approximately [100 lifetimes](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A1-23%3B+Luke+8%3A4-15%3B+Mark+4%3A2-20&version=NLT) of preaching the gospel message within a 7 year period.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in<span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[a]</span> the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.‚Äù &mdash; Matthew 28:19-20 ESV

I've decided to teach my hard won computer programming experience to others in hopes that they would be able to spread the gospel message more efficiently, and in doing so, curb the darkness which is at our very doorsteps, threatening the very fabric of our society.

After much deliberation, all articles pertaining to the Bible will remain free and accessible to everyone at anytime [through our blog](https://bit.ly/3G0CTAO). Instead the way I've decided to support and grow this ministry is by offering courses on computer programming and ministry automation through Patreon.

**Refresh page for updates in real time.** We will eventually provide links to the courses, but we will need time to prepare the full curriculum. Please be patient and bare with us while we methodically create a friendly end user experience. A free introduction will appear here in this article so bookmark and check back every couple days for updates. We will also present the courses on our [twitter page](https://twitter.com/SevenShepherd).

Sincerely,

In my youth I often asked myself &mdash; whilst in deep reflection &mdash; *"... are my options really only between poverty or slavery?"* Not knowing the answers I meditated on the perplexing question for years until simple truths hit me. During the process of dire contemplation I became monastic (secluded and contemplative) in my Christianity.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 10:15 KJV

I stumbled upon a verse, that when correctly rendered, essentially said that I was foolish because I did not understand how to do business in the city, and that this was the cause of, not only mine, but all of our hardships financially. -->
