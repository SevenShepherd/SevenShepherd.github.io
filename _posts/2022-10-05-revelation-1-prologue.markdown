<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Doulos ∴</div>

The Greek word for slaves is <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">δοῦλος</span> ([doulos](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1401/mgnt/tr/0-1/)), and is pronounced [🔊 doo'-los](https://youtu.be/MKFLawatxlY).<sup>[BLB](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1401/lsb/mgnt/0-1/)</sup> In a spiritual sense, the connotation of the word slaves in this context is one who has ***voluntarily*** sold himself into slavery to Jesus Christ. A good translation is the word “bondservant”, in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another.<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A1&version=NET)</sup>


The New Testament uses doulos to describe an individual who is totally subordinate to a master (cf. Mt 8:9; 24:46; 2Pe 2:19) and even owned by that master (Phile 1:16-19). Jesus is our Lord and master (2Co 4:5), and we are His slaves (Ro 1:1; Ph 1:1).<sup>[[Site]](https://lsbible.org/faqs/)</sup>

The word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another.<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A1&version=NET)</sup> This underscores His great redemption in buying believers from slavery to sin (Ro 6:16, 1 Co 6:20; 7:23). This also underscores the believer’s absolute surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ (Ro 6:16-17).<sup>[[Site]](https://lsbible.org/faqs/)</sup>

<!-- tn Grk “slaves.” Although this translation frequently renders δοῦλος (doulos) as “slave,” the connotation is often of one who has sold himself into slavery; in a spiritual sense, the idea is that of becoming a slave of God or of Jesus Christ voluntarily. The voluntary notion is conspicuous here; hence, the translation “servants.” In any case, the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that “‘servant’ for ‘slave’ is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times…in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished” (BDAG 260 s.v.). A good translation is “bondservant” (sometimes found in the ASV for δοῦλος), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force. -->

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Apokalypsis ∴</div>

The term &#8220;*Revelation*&#8221; comes from the Greek word <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">Ἀποκάλυψις</span> ([Apokalypsis](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g602/mgnt/tr/0-1/), sometimes transliterated as [*apokalupsis*](https://biblehub.com/greek/602.htm)), and is pronounced [🔊 ap-ok-al'-oop-sis](https://youtu.be/ohNVe34B_BM). It means <span style="font-style:Italic;color:#00802b;">“Unveiling”</span> or <span style="font-style:Italic;color:#00802b;">“Disclosure”</span> and can often be found in the epistles (Ro 2:5; 8:19; 1Co 1:7; 2Th 1:7; 1Pe 1:7,13; 4:13; Lk 2:32).

<!-- The KJV has a myriad of ways it likes to translate the same word in the epistles, examples such as a *"manifestation"* in Romans 8:19, a *coming* in 1 Cor. 1:7, a *"revealing"* 2 Thes. 1:7, and an *"appearing"* in 1 Pet. 1:7. Modern translations that use much older underlying manuscripts are much more consistent, you can see this consistency by clicking the verses above translated in the superior ESV. -->

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Commentary ∴</div>

<!-- The Book of Revelation, then, concerns the unveiling or appearing of our precious Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. It is not the unfolding of the story of St. John the Divine, or even of prophetical truth, but rather the message of the “appearing of Christ.” This appearing takes place at the Rapture in Re 4:1, as well as at the hour of His return to the earth when every eye shall see Him Re 1:7. -->

With our newfound understanding of the underlying meaning of the word Revelation, we can conclude that The Book of Revelation is about the unveiling of [our great God and Savior Jesus Christ](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/deity-07/) (2Pe 1:1; Tit 2:13). This unveiling takes place at the rapture (Re 4:1), as well as at the hour of His return to the earth when every eye shall see Him (Re 1:7).

Jesus is simultaneously the One revealed and the Revealer. God The Father gives this Revelation (the unveiled truth) to Jesus (Mt 11:27; Re 5:7). This truth was then sent by Jesus to John (Re 10:9) through His angel to show His slaves in the Churches what will happen soon (Re 1:1), because the time is near (Re 1:3). This certainly pictures the present hour when signs pointing to Jesus' return are beginning to appear with alarming frequency. 

The Book of Revelation is a study of signs. From the sign of the Holy Spirit presented as seven spirits (Re 1:4), to the sign of the seven golden lampstands and the seven stars (Re 1:20). Thus, through signs, we come to an understanding of this gloriously revealed portion of Scripture. 

In the epilogue, John, unlike Daniel, is told not to seal his prophecy (Re 22:10; cf. Dan. 12:4). John’s visions are important for his first-century readers as well as for later generations of believers.

<!-- Secondly, we see that this revelation was given to Jesus Christ, as is everything, for Jesus said, *All things are delivered unto me of my Father* Mt 11:27. They are presented unto Him to *shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass.* The term *shortly* in the original means *"rapidity of action once there is a beginning."* This certainly pictures the present hour when signs pointing to His return are beginning to appear with alarming frequency. These truths, then, are sent and signified by Christ's angel unto John, the writer of the book, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Notice that the four letters of the word *signified* spell SIGN. Why? The Book of Revelation is a study of signs. There is the sign of the Holy Spirit presented as seven spirits Re 1:4 and the sign of the seven golden candlesticks and the seven stars in Re 1:20. Thus, through signs, we come to an understanding of this gloriously revealed portion of Scripture. -->

<!-- NOTE ON 1:1 revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus is both the One revealed (referred to variously as Son of Man, Lion of Judah, Lamb, Word of God) and the Revealer. God transmits the unveiled truth to Jesus (Re 5:7), and his angel conveys it to John (Re 10:9) for God’s servants in the churches. The prophecy must … take place because it is secured by God’s sovereign purpose and power. It will take place soon, because “the time is near” (Re 1:3). In the epilogue, John, unlike Daniel, is told not to seal his prophecy (Re 22:10; cf. Dan. 12:4). John’s visions are important for his first-century readers as well as for later generations of believers. -->

<!-- <blockquote cite="https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Rev+1">

<div class="mt" style="font-size:21px;">꧁ 𝕍𝕖𝕣𝕤𝕖 𝟛 ꧂</div>

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3" style="font-weight:bold;color:black;">3&#160;</span> Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and keep the things which are written in it, for the time is near. </div>

</blockquote>

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Makarios ∴</div>

The Greek word for Blessed is <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">μακάριος</span> ([makarios](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3107/lsb/mgnt/0-1/)), and is pronounced [🔊 mak-ar'-ee-os](https://youtu.be/QOIbiTKYyu4). This word can alternately be translated as [happy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A3&version=EXB;MOUNCE). 

This is the first of seven blessings which are given to those who read or hear, as well as obey God’s Word. The remaining six blessings can be found in Rev. 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7, 14.

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Commentary ∴</div>

Verse three demonstrates that the apocalypse is not some impossible to understand, esoteric book. In fact this verse proves the complete opposite. God is giving blessings to those who read, hear, and obey. If people were unable to comprehend what was written, there would be no one who could read or hear this book.

<!-- Revelation is understandable and fills the heart with joy once one sees its glorious message concerning the Saviour. -->

<span style="font-size:19px;">For The Time Is Near</span>

When the bible says that **the time is *near***, or that it is ***at hand***, this is telling us that the Return of Christ is imminent. Christ's return is the next event on Father God's calender and could happen at anytime. It could happen right now while I type this commentary, or in a few days from now when you're reading it, or decades from now, etc. 

The Bible teaches us that only the Father in heaven knows the day and hour, not even the Son, or His angels (Mt 24:36). We are instructed to be alert and disciplined unto prayer, because the end of all things is at hand (1Pe 4:7 ESV). The Bible warns us that the day of the Lord will come suddenly, like a thief in the night! (1Th 5:2–4; 2Pe 3:10) 

This fast approaching time is compared to the dawn of a new day, from a night that is almost gone (Ro 13:12). Christians should fix their gaze heavenwards, as a crown of righteousness awaits those of us who watch for our God's return (Tit 2:13; 2Tim 4:8).

> Let your considerate spirit be known to all men. **The Lord is near**. &mdash; Phil 4:5 LSB

Since the ***Lord is near***, it is important that we let others observe our conduct as gentle, kind, considerate, and patient. This includes being able to teach with patience and kindness (2Tim 2:24 NLT; 1Jn 4:7-8,11-12; Gal 5:14; Jn 15:12; Ph 2:3; Heb 13:1-2 NET). 

> A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people. &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:24 NLT

If people are causing divisions among you, consider these verses (Tit 3:10 NLT; 2Ti 3:1-5 ESV; 2Th 2:3).

<span style="font-size:19px;">What Is Sin?</span>

Sin separates us from God (Is 59:2). All sin results in judgement &mdash; the payoff is death and eventually, the Great White Throne Judgement (Ro 1:24-32; 6:23; 1 Co 6:9,10; Gal 5:19-21).<sup>[JVI]</sup>

**Revelation 21:8; 22:15 provides a comprehensive picture of those who are damned for all eternity.**

- *The fearful*&mdash;those who do not accept Christ to escape being ridiculed (Matthew 10:32).
- *Unbelievers*&mdash;those who do not believe in and recieve the Lord Jesus Christ (Jn 8:24; Mt 12:32 NLT).
- *The abominable*&mdash;those who engage in wicked practices (Titus 1:16).
- *Murderers*&mdash;those who kill others or ***hate*** as hatred is equivalent to murder (1Jn 3:15; 1Jn 2:9 NLT; 1Jn 4:20 NLT).
- *Whoremongers*&mdash;those who engage in fornication or consort with prostitutes (Eph 5:5-8).
- *Sorcerers*&mdash;those who practice witchcraft, demonism, and follow after the occult. Sorcery comes from the Greek word [pharmakeía](https://www.gotquestions.org/pharmakeia-in-the-Bible.html), meaning *"enchantment with drugs."* Thus, drug users as well as pushers are included in the guilty verdict for judgement (Re 21:8; 22:15; Gal 5:19-21).
- *Idolaters*&mdash;those who worship or reverence anything other than the living and true God.
- *Liars*&mdash; also bearing false witness (John 8:44; Proverbs 6:16-19)
- *Dogs*&mdash;false professors (2Pe 2:21-22)
- *Homosexuals*&mdash;(Romans 1:18-32)
- *The unrighteous*&mdash;those who trust in self, works, a false religious system, or mere *"religion"* for salvation (Titus 3:5).
- *Fornicators*&mdash;those who engage in premarital and extramarital sex (1Co 6:9,14-18).
- *The wicked*&mdash;those who disregard all morality and moral standards.
- *The covetous*&mdash;those who desire all things for themselves, especially that which belongs to others (Eph 5:5-8).
- *The malicious*&mdash;those who willfully seek to destroy the person and property of others (James 1:26)
- *The envious*&mdash;those resentful of others.
- *Debaters*&mdash;those who would rather argue with God than accept His truth.
- *Deceivers*&mdash;those who purposely mislead or betray others (2Ti 3:13).
- *Maligners*&mdash;those who speak evil of, defame, or **slander** others (James 3:2-3; Pr 11:9 NLT; James 4:11-12; Pr 10:18 ESV; 20:19; 1Pe 2:1; Ps 101:5 ESV; Pr 11:12 NLT; Mt 5:22 ESV; Lk 6:45 NLT).
- *Whisperers*&mdash;those who gossip (Pr 16:28 NLT).
- *Backbiters*&mdash;those who constantly find fault with others and speak maliciously about them.
- *Haters of God*&mdash;
- *Despisers*&mdash;those filled with contempt toward God and man.
- *The Proud*&mdash;those possessing an excessively high opinion of themselves.
- *Boasters*&mdash;those who exalt self.
- *Inventors of evil things*&mdash;
- *The disobedient to parents*&mdash;
- *Those without understanding*&mdash;resulting from unconcern or rejection of truth.
- *Covenant breakers*&mdash;those who do not keep their word.
- *Those whose affections are contrary to the laws of God and nature*&mdash;
- *The implacable*&mdash;those exhibiting extreme stubbornness to the point of refusing to yield to the convicting power of the Holy Spirit (Pr 1:24-28; Ac 7:51-52)
- *The unmerciful*&mdash;those who lack compassion (Eph 4:32)
- *Adulterers*&mdash;those who practice extramarital sex (1Co 6:9-10)
- *The effeminate*&mdash;generally younger persons in the process of becoming homosexuals or sodomites.
- *Abusers of themselves with mankind*&mdash;hardened homosexuals (Gen. 19:5)
- *Thieves*&mdash;(1Co 6:10)
- *Drunkards*&mdash;those given to and overcome by alcohol (Pr 20:1; 23:20-21; Lk 21:34; Ro 13:13; 1Co 6:10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:18).
- *Revilers*&mdash;those who use abusive or contemptuous language (James 1:26).
- *Extortioners*&mdash;those who exact money from or take advantage of others through violence, threats, or misuse of authority.

People who **practice** these sins will be Judged before the [Great White Throne](https://www.gotquestions.org/great-white-throne-judgment.html). 

<!-- *"Is there any hope?"* you might be thinking to yourself. *"And such were some of you; ...but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."* (1Co 6:11; 1Jn 1:7; Jn 3:17). -->

<!-- There is not a sin that can keep a **true believer** out of [Heaven](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/heaven/). God's Word clearly states that some Christians will be saved *"so as by fire."* They lose everything except their salvation. Because of it they will be *"ashamed"* in Christ's presence (1Jn 2:28 KJV).  -->

<!-- If believers were left behind at the Rapture because of some sin in their lives, who would the *"ashamed"* be at that investigative session? Rewards are lost because of disobedience and disobedience is a sin (Ro 5:19; James 5:17). -->

<span style="font-size:19px;">What Is A True Believer?</span>

A true believer is someone who does not make a **practice** of sin (1Jn 3:9-10 ESV; Gal 5:19-21 NLT), and whose life is filled with the fruit of the spirit (Gal 5:22-23). 

> **No one born of God makes a practice of sinning**, for God's[a] seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. &mdash; 1Jn 3:9 English Standard Version

True believers are saved by grace (Eph 2:8-9). A true believer may sin during his life, but he never makes a practice of sin.

<!-- ; James 2:23-25). -->

<!-- > Let your considerate spirit be known to all men. **The Lord is near**. &mdash; Phil 4:5 LSB

Since the ***Lord is near***, it is important that we let others observe our conduct as gentle, kind, considerate, and patient. This includes being able to teach with patience and kindness (2Tim 2:24 NLT; 1Jn 4:7-8,11-12; Gal 5:14; Jn 15:12; Ph 2:3; Heb 13:1-2 NET). 

> A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people. &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:24 NLT -->

This is how we prove that we are truly of God (Mt 3:8 NLT), and that it wasn't just lip service (James 1:22 NLT; Is 29:13 NLT; Mt 15:8 NLT) when you asked God into your heart. The Bible teaches that you will be able to identify a true Christian by their fruit, that is by the way that they act (Mt 7:16 NLT). 

If a Christian's life is devoid of the fruit of the spirit (Gal 5:22-23), and instead is full of the works of the flesh (Gal 5:19-21), these people have fooled themselves into believing that they are Christians (James 1:22 NLT). Remember that it is only those who do the will of the Father that will enter Heaven (Mt 7:21).

No one who makes a ***practice*** of sin is a true Christian (1Jn 3:9 ESV), they will not make it to Heaven (Gal 5:19-21) because they've chosen to be children of the devil (1Jn 3:10 ESV). Every person who does not produce good fruit will be cut down and cast into fire (Mt 3:10 NLT).

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Commentary ∴</div>



<span style="font-size:19px;">The Seven Churches</span>

John now focuses his attention on seven local churches.<sup>[JVI]</sup> Seven symbolizes completeness (God's number of perfection) and implies that Christ addresses the whole church through these seven churches.<sup>[ESVSB]</sup> The number also pictures seven different sets of conditions reflecting the history of God's people through the church age.<sup>[JVI]</sup> Asia was a Roman province in what is now part of western Turkey,<sup>[[EXB/NLT]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=EXB;NLT)</sup> and is not referring to the continent of Asia.<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=NET)</sup>

The Roman province of Asia made up about one-third of modern Asia Minor and was on the western side. Asia is situated to the west of the region of Phrygia and Galatia.<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=NET)</sup>

<span style="font-size:19px;">Grace To You And Peace</span>

God's salutation, found in 19/27 books in the NT is presented in this verse as well: *Grace be unto you and peace*, as the KJV puts it. Notice how *Grace* comes before *peace*, this is the order God shows his unmerited favor. Sinners cannot have peace without first receiving grace. This grace was shown at Calvary and is freely bestowed upon all who believe and receive Christ (Ep 2:8-9; Tit 2:11; Rom 5:1; Col 1:20; Rom 15:13).<sup>[JVI]</sup>

<!-- We also find that the message of grace and peace is from the entire Trinity.  -->

John’s greeting (the message of grace and peace) comes “from” all three persons of the Trinity.<sup>[ESVSB]</sup> First, the Father who is, and who was, and who is to come; then from the seven Spirits which are before the throne (a designation of the blessed Holy Spirit in all of His holiness, for seven means perfection).<sup>[JVI]</sup>

<span style="font-size:19px;">The One Who Is And Who Was And Who Is To Come</span>

These three descriptions function like titles for God; Ex. 3:14–15.<sup>[[EXB]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=EXB)</sup>

The passage appears to be an allusion to Exod 3:14 (in the LXX) where God refers to himself as “he who is” (ὁ ὤν), the same wording in Greek as here in Rev 1:4. Thus, it appears that John is wanting to leave the divine name untouched (perhaps to allude to God’s immutability, or as a pointer to the Old Testament as the key to unlocking the meaning of this book), irrespective of what it “looks” like grammatically.<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=NET)</sup> 

<!-- The translation has placed the “he who is” in quotation marks to indicate to the reader that the syntactical awkwardness is intentional. (For further comments, see ExSyn 63).  -->

BDAG (A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament) 106 s.v. ἀπό 5.d states: “The expr. εἰρήνη ἀπὸ ‘ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος’ Rv 1:4 is quite extraordinary. It may be an interpretation of the name Yahweh already current, or an attempt to show reverence for the divine name by preserving it unchanged, or simply one more of the grammatical peculiarities so frequent in Rv.”<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=NET)</sup>

<span style="font-size:19px;">The Seven Spirits</span> 

This is referring either to angels or to the “sevenfold Spirit”—the Holy Spirit portrayed in his perfection (the number seven indicating completeness).<sup>[[EXB]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A4&version=EXB)</sup>

The Holy Spirit is presented as one person in Revelation (Re 3:6, 13; cf. Eph. 4:4), but that he also appears as “seven spirits” (cf. Rev. 3:1; 4:5) which represent perfection, and as “seven torches of fire” (Re 4:5) and “seven eyes” (Re 5:6) to express his omnipresence and omniscience.<sup>[ESVSB]</sup>

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5" style="font-weight:bold;color:black;">5&#160;</span> and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood⁠— </div>

</blockquote>

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Commentary ∴</div>

<span style="font-size:19px;">The Faithful Witness</span> 

In much the same way that Jesus was the faithful witness even unto death (1Ti 6:13), Christians are called to be faithful witnesses as well (Re 2:13; 12:11; 20:4).<sup>[ESVSB]</sup> The Greek term translated witness can mean both “witness” and “martyr.”<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev+1%3A5&version=NET)</sup> Jesus is “the” quintessential faithful witness.

<span style="font-size:19px;">The Firstborn Of The Dead, And The Ruler Of The Kings Of The Earth.</span> 

The firstborn of the dead, means Jesus has overcome or triumphed over death itself and that he is sovereign over all earthly powers (cf. Re 19:16). This fact was meant to comfort John's persecuted readers.<sup>[ESVSB]</sup>

The Lord Jesus Christ is also called the *"ruler of the kings of the earth"*. This is referring to the future when the *"Prince of Peace"* of Is 9:6 returns to earth as the *"KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS"* (Re 19:16). This glorious event will be the fulfillment of Psalm 2:6 ESV which states *"... I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill."* At that time the Lord Jesus shall *"have dominion from sea to sea And from the River to the ends of the earth."* (Ps 72:8)<sup>[JVI]</sup>

<span style="font-size:19px;">What about Lazarus?</span>

So the next question you might ask is, *"Why is Christ the first begotten of the dead, when Lazarus and others were raised first?"* The answer is that others were raised from physical death to physical life only to eventually die again. Christ Jesus is the first to have been resurrected with a new immortal glorified body &mdash; never to die again! This is why Christ is the *"first of the resurrection from the dead"* (Ac 26:23).<sup>[JVI]</sup>

<!-- This is why Christ *"should be the first that should rise from the dead"* (Ac 26:23 KJV) -->

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Prōtotokos ∴</div>

<span style="font-size:19px;">Beware The Cults "Firstborn"</span>

The firstborn or first begotten is referring to the Resurrection of Christ Jesus.

Educated scholars and professors of ancient Hebrew and Koine Greek have revealed that the word for **firstborn** in Heb 1:6; Col 1:15,18; Rom 8:29 is the Greek word <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">πρωτότοκος</span> ([prōtotokos](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4416/lsb/tr/0-1/)), pronounced [🔊 pro-tot-ok'-os](https://youtu.be/LUb6g3auXbQ), which means: <span style="font-style:italic;color:Green;">superior, preeminent in rank, and above</span>.

Let's look at a few examples of how the cults have abandoned science, facts, and reason and denied sound scholarship by seeking out false teachers as the Bible foretold would happen (2Tim 4:3 ESV).

The cults have twisted (2Pe 3:16) the underlying meaning of the word firstborn, from its true meaning as superior, or preeminent in rank when referring to the Resurrection of Jesus, to the ridiculously false meaning "first created" in a failed effort to strip Jesus of his [**deity**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/deity/) and conform the holy scriptures to their unholy false doctrines.

<!-- > And when He again brings the **firstborn** into the world, He says, “And let all the angels of God worship Him.” &mdash; Hebrews 1:6 -->

> Who is the image of the invisible God, the **firstborn** of all creation. &mdash; Colossians 1:15

<!-- > And He is the head of the body, the church; Who is the beginning, the **firstborn** from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything. &mdash; Colossians 1:18

> Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the **firstborn** among many brothers; Romans 8:29 -->

<!-- Christ is *"from everlasting"* (Mi 5:2). Jesus is prophesied to be Mighty God in Isaiah 9:6.

> For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, **Mighty God**, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

God the Father, in the Old Testament, is also called “Mighty God” in Isaiah 10:21 and Jeremiah 32:18, the same title that is ascribed to the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Remember that there is only ONE God (Is 43:10;44:6,8,24)! Do not let the cults deceive you. -->

In this first example the word “firstborn” in Colossians 1:15 is the Greek word “prototokos.” It does not mean “first created” as the cults say. There’s another Greek word for ‘first created’ (protoktistos) and Paul did not use that word.

📖 The **context** makes that clear. And that’s why it’s so important to always examine the context and allow Scripture to interpret Scripture. Why is Jesus superior over all creation? Well, the very next verse explains, that Jesus is superior to everything, because He is the One who made everything!

- Colossians 1:16-17
> 16 “For in Him **all things** were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities⁠—**all things** have been created through Him and for Him.” 17 “And He is before **all things**, And in Him **all things** hold together.” 

⚠️ To deal with the implications of these two verses (Col. 1:16–17) some cults have added four words ("other") into their false bible translations that are not in the original Greek to give people the impression that Jesus only made some things—not ALL things. They have been reproved and proved to be liars according to the Bible (Proverbs 30:5-6)

<!-- ❔ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3f33e8;">Questions For The Cults:</span> Col 1:16, in talking about Jesus, says that"... All [other] things have been created through him and FOR HIM". If Jesus were Michael the Archangel at the time of creation, would an angel have created all things for himself? Isa 43:7 says God created "everyone ... for my OWN glory ..."

- Isaiah 43:7
> Everyone who is called by My name,
And whom I have created **for My glory**,
Whom I have formed, even whom I have made.” -->

Further, we can add insult to injury by observing that Jesus is God because [only God created all things!](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/deity-11/)

> Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb,
“I, Yahweh, am the maker of **all things**, Stretching out the heavens **by Myself** And spreading out the earth **all alone**,

Jesus made all things (Jn 1:3; Col 1:16-17), and Yahweh made all of those very same things. You better believe Jesus is Yahweh God! It's as plain as day. Undeniable, irrefutable, Indisputable proof that JESUS IS GOD.

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and **the Word was God**. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 **All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.** ... 14 And **the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us,** and we beheld His glory, glory as of **the only begotten from the Father,** full of grace and truth.

Is it any wonder that the Apostle John went through great lengths stating just that. 

So, if the cults try to tell you that the term “firstborn” means Jesus was the first being God created, gently tell them that they’re mistaken and that the passage (Colossians 1:15) is actually teaching that Jesus is superior or above creation.

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Monogenés ∴</div>

<span style="font-size:19px;">Beware The Cults "Only Begotten"</span>

Only begotten is referring to the incarnation of Christ Jesus.

In an act of unparalleled bias, the cults have deliberately changed the underlying Greek manuscripts to conform to their false doctrines. Some of these cults have attempted to twist (2Pe 3:16) the meaning of the word ***begotten*** and force it to erroneously mean that Jesus was somehow “created” in a feeble attempt to strip Jesus of his [**deity**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/deity/). Consider John 3:16 where Jesus is speaking to a Pharisee by the name of Nicodemus:

> “For God so loved the world, that He gave His **only begotten** Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”

Educated scholars and professors in ancient Koine Greek reveal the word for ***only begotten*** to be <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">μονογενής</span>, transliterated as [monogenés](https://biblehub.com/greek/3439.htm), and pronounced [🔊 mon-og-en-ace'](https://youtu.be/DOnvb7dV-z0). It means <span style="font-style:italic;color:Green;">“unique,” “only,” or “one of its kind.”</span> and it comes from two Greek terms: <span style="font-style:italic;color:Green;">monos</span> meaning <span style="font-style:italic;color:Green;">“one”</span> and the noun <span style="font-style:italic;color:Green;">genes</span> which means <span style="font-style:italic;color:Green;">“kind” or “type.”</span>

This is why over 100 scholars who translated the English Standard Version were justified in removing the traditional label of "only begotten Son" and going with the more literal "only Son".<sup>[[ESV/EXB/NET/NLT]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:16&version=ESV;EXB;NET;NLT)</sup>

> “For God so loved the world, that he gave his **only** Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. &mdash; English Standard Version

That’s what Jesus is talking about in John 3:16. He is not saying that God the Father created Him. He’s saying that He is God’s only, unique, one of a kind Savior! This is why only He has immortality (1Ti 6:16), and why Peter could boldly pronounce to the Sanhedrin in Acts 4:12:

> “And **there is salvation in no one else**, for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.”

Jesus is the “monogenes,” the only, one of a kind Savior! There is salvation in no one else. Christ is *"from everlasting"* (Mi 5:2). Jesus is prophesied to be Mighty God in Isaiah 9:6.

> For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, **Mighty God**, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

God the Father, in the Old Testament, is also called “Mighty God” in Isaiah 10:21 and Jeremiah 32:18, the same title that is ascribed to the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Remember that there is only ONE God (Is 43:10;44:6,8,24)! Do not let the cults deceive you.

<!-- 1 Thess. 4:16–17 cry of command … voice of an archangel … trumpet of God. The three noises summon the dead to wake from their slumber. The only “archangel” identified in the Bible is Michael (Jude 9). Trumpets in the OT proclaimed the Lord’s presence (Ex. 19:16; 1 Chron. 16:6; Ps. 47:5; Joel 2:1; Zech. 9:14); in Jewish tradition, the “trumpet” was associated with battle, the day of the Lord, and the resurrection (cf. 1 Cor. 15:52). first … Then. Dead Christians rise from their graves to the realm of the living, and then the living and the dead together are caught up from the earth into the air to meet Christ.

<span style="font-size:19px;">Every Eye Will See Him</span>

Notice that every eye sees Him. That is why this great event is described as the "revealing" or "revelation" of Christ and occurs when He comes as the *"KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS"* (Re 19:11-16). This serves as a preview of what will happen when He returns with His saints in Revelation Chapter 19.<sup>[JVI]</sup>

Isn't it thrilling to know that when *"the lightning comes from the east and appears even to the west"* (Mt 24:27 NET), that every eye will witness the spectacle of the ages?<sup>[JVI]</sup>


<span style="font-size:19px;">Those Who Pierced Him</span>

*"EVERY EYE WILL SEE HIM, EVEN THOSE WHO PIERCED HIM"* is a reference to a prophecy made in the Old Testament (Zechariah 12:10).

> “And I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that **they will look on <span style="font-size:23px;">Me</span> whom they have pierced;** and **they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.**

The very first verse in Zec 12:1 reveals that Yahweh is the one who is talking. Verses 2 through 12 are a single discourse tied to the “Thus declares the LORD [Yahweh]”.

> The oracle of the word of **Yahweh** concerning Israel. **Thus declares Yahweh** who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,

The Hebrew term בְּכוֹר (bekhor, “firstborn”), translated usually in the LXX by πρωτότοκος (prōtotokos), has unmistakable messianic overtones as the use of the Greek term in the NT to describe Jesus makes clear (cf. Col 1:15, 18). Thus, the idea of God being pierced sets the stage for the fatal wounding of Jesus, the Messiah and the Son of God (cf. John 19:37; Rev 1:7). Note that some English translations supply “son” from the context (e.g., NIV, TEV, NLT).<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+12%3A10&version=NET;NLT)</sup>

We can conclude that Jesus is Yahweh God and that [they pierced Yahweh on the cross!](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/deity-16/) since Jesus is Yahweh God made manifest in the flesh (Jn 1:1-3,14; Ph 2:5-8; Co 2:9).


<span style="font-size:19px;">Mourn Over Him</span>

Most scholars think the wailing is a reaction to judgment instead of the kind of grief that leads to salvation.<sup>[ESVSB]</sup> 

When He comes in power and great glory to smite the nations *"and all the tribes of the earth will MOURN OVER HIM."* This is because He comes for judgement and none will escape. As John envisions the hour when *"Behold, the Lord came with *many thousands of His holy ones,"* (Jude 1:14-15), he victoriously cries, *"Amen! Amen!"* (Re 1:7 KJV) The Greek for *"even so"* is *"Amen,"* and *"Amen"* is the Hebrew for *"even so"*. John is literally shouting the praise or praises of God in two languages.<sup>[JVI]</sup> 

<!-- as he says, *"Amen and Amen, He is coming!"* -->

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Ophthalmos ∴</div>

<span style="font-size:19px;">Beware The Cults "EYE"</span>

Some cults falsely teach that Jesus’ Second Coming occurred spiritually and invisibly. Yet, the Bible preaches that the entire world will see this event, *“EVERY EYE WILL SEE HIM”*. That the return of Christ will be *"as the lightning flashes in the east and shines to the west"* (Mt 24:27 NLT).

Jesus warned about future cults that might try to teach that he was hiding or invisible when he said *“So if someone tells you, ‘Look, the Messiah is out in the desert,’ don’t bother to go and look. Or, **‘Look, he is hiding here,’** don’t believe it!"* (Mt 24:23-27 NLT).

The Apostle John warned us as well when he said *"For many deceivers have gone out into the world, **those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh.** Such a one is the **deceiver and the antichrist.**"* (2Jn 1:7)

These same cultists will try to tell you falsely that the *“EYE”* in *“EVERY EYE WILL SEE HIM”* means 'eyes of understanding' or that these are 'spiritual eyes'... This is incorrect. The word *“EYE”* (Rev. 1:7) in Greek is <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#00802b;">ὀφθαλμός</span> ([ophthalmós](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3788/lsb/mgnt/0-1/)), and pronounced [🔊 of-thal-mos'](https://youtu.be/I296_lIXf3Y). 

This is the same Greek word used for the literal physical eyes of the blind people Jesus healed (Mt 20:34). The word *“EVERY”* is the Greek word “pas” and it means just what it says: “every” or “all.” 

Jesus' return is also described *“His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives”* (Zec 14:4). So not only will every physical eye see His return, but Christ's literal physical feet will stand on the Mount of Olives.

Did Paul believe that the future judge of the world, Jesus Christ, would be an immortal MAN or an invisible spirit creature?

<div class="mt" style="font-size:19px;">∴ Commentary ∴</div>

It's important to note the alternate reading of this verse, so as to be thorough, and that this alternative reading is likely a later addition. As the WEB Bible notes, both the Majority Text & Critical text disagree with the Textus Receptus. TR adds “the Beginning and the End” and omits “God”.

> I am Alpha and Omega, **the beginning and the ending**, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. &mdash; King James Version

The shorter reading “Omega” (ὦ, ō) has superior ms evidence (א1 A C 1611) to the longer reading which includes “the beginning and the end” (ἀρχὴ καὶ τέλος or ἡ ἀρχὴ καὶ τὸ τέλος, archē kai telos or hē archē kai to telos), found in א*,2 1854 2050 2329 2351 MA lat bo. There is little reason why a scribe would have deleted the words, but their clarifying value and the fact that they harmonize with Re 21:6 indicate that they are a secondary addition to the text.<sup>[[NET]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Re+1%3A8&version=NET)</sup>

<span style="font-size:19px;">Jesus Is The Alpha And The Omega</span>

The coming one is the Lord God, Alpha and Omega (first and last letters of the Gk. alphabet) (see Rev. 1:17; 22:13). Jesus is the beginning of all history (the Creator) and also the goal for whom all things are made (all history is moving toward glorifying him).<sup>[ESVSB]</sup>

There is no doubt that the title of *"Alpha and Omega"* belongs to Almighty God. There is also no doubt that the title of *"the first and the last"* is Jesus (Re 1:17-18).

> And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, “Do not fear; **I am the first and the last**, 18 **and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive** forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.

The Father never died, the Holy Spirit never died, *"the first and the last"* is Jesus. This can also be found in other key verses (Re 2:8).

> “And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: This is what **THE FIRST AND THE LAST, who was dead, and has come to life**, says:

Now here's the profound part, the *"Alpha and the Omega"* is *"THE FIRST AND THE LAST"* (Re 22:12-16).

> 12 “Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to his work. 13 **I am the Alpha and the Omega, THE FIRST AND THE LAST**, the beginning and the end.” 14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the authority to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city. 15 Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying. 16 “**I, Jesus**, sent My angel to bear witness to you of these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”

🤯 **Jesus is Almighty God** who is speaking in Re 1:8. The covenant name Yahweh (Ex 3:14-16; Jn 8:56-59) is also identified as the first and the last (Is 41:4; 44:6; 48:12; Jn 1:49+Is 44:6). Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega, Lord God, the Almighty, Yahweh, made manifest in the flesh (Jn 1:1-3,14; Ph 2:5-8; Co 2:9).

<!-- is Yahweh, Lord God, The Almighty, Alpha and the Omega, made manifest in the flesh (Jn 1:1-3,14; Ph 2:5-8; Co 2:9). -->
