It's easy for a child, or one who is new to the faith, or immature in it, to wonder whether or not the hardships that they endure are the result of judgments against them for the things that they have said or done. I'm writing this article to reassure you that this type of worry is unwarranted for all who are truly in Christ Jesus. Those with a genuine saving faith, a living faith.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> So now, those who are in Christ Jesus are not ·judged guilty<sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A1-2&version=NET;EXB" style="color:#A8A8A8;">[a]</a></sup> <span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[condemned; punished for their sins]</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> <span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[<sup>L</sup> For]</span> ·Through <span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[or In]</span> Christ Jesus the ·law <span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[principle; or power]</span> of the Spirit that brings life set you<sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A1-2&version=NET;EXB" style="color:#A8A8A8;">[b]</a></sup> free from the ·law <span style="color:#A8A8A8;">[principle; or power]</span> that brings sin and death. &mdash; [Romans 9:1-2 EXB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A1-2&version=NET;EXB)

It's important to understand this and keep the inspired words of the Holy God within you, because the children of the devil are many, and Satan will use them like pawns to speak against you when hardship finds you. Remember that in this world, all men will endure the vicissitudes of life, and it is not because you made a mistake, or over something you're truly contrite and repentant of, no, it is simply the way life is for us all.

> ... For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and **he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike**. &mdash; [Matthew 5:45 NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:45&version=ESV;NLT)

No matter who you are, how rich or poor, how prideful you have become, or how humble, you will all die like the animals do. It is better that the living consider this reality than to be naive and oblivious to it.

> For the fate of humans<sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3:19&version=NET" style="color:#A8A8A8;">[a]</a></sup> and the fate of animals are the same: As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath. There is no advantage for humans over animals, for both are fleeting. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 3:19 NET

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> One person dies in prosperity, completely comfortable and secure, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> the picture of good health, vigorous and fit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> Another person dies in bitter poverty, never having tasted the good life. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> **But both are buried in the same dust, both eaten by the same maggots.** &mdash; [Job 21:23-26 NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+21%3A23-26&version=EXB;NLT)

<!-- > It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for this is the end of all mankind, and the living will lay it to heart. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 7:2 ESV -->

> It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of everyone; the living should take this to heart. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 7:2 NIV

<!-- > Everyone shares the same fate<sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecc+9%3A2-4&version=NET;EXB" style="color:#A8A8A8;">[a]</a></sup> — the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad,<sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecc+9%3A2-4&version=NET;EXB" style="color:#A8A8A8;">[b]</a></sup> ... &mdash; [Ecclesiastes 9:2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecc+9%3A2&version=ESV;NET;EXB;NLT) -->

We all share this same fate, from the evilest human being to the most righteous.

Remember that there are those out there who are both wise and skilled yet suffer poverty, there are those who spend many years in education but never amount to anything, and elite soldiers in the prime of their lives who are done in by an amateur; this is all by chance and we can never predict when hard times will come. Like an animal that is caught in a net, so you shall be when your time comes.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn’t always win the battle. <span style="font-weight:bold;">The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy.</span> And those who are educated don’t always lead successful lives. <span style="font-weight:bold;">It is all decided by chance</span>, by being in the right place at the right time. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">People can never predict when hard times might come.</span> Like fish in a net or birds in a trap, people are caught by sudden tragedy. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 9:11 NLT

So remember not to be fooled by the pride of this life, and instead to build your rewards in heaven rather than on earth, where the moth and rust corrupts and decays all the worthless physical and material wealth that you have wasted your time and damaged your walk with God by collecting.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. &mdash; Matthew 6:19-21 KJV

Let us not be like the [seed that fell among the thorns](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A1-23%3B+Luke+8%3A4-15%3B+Mark+4%3A2-20&version=NLT), for naked we entered this world and naked we will leave it. We should be content with shelter, food, and clothes.

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> After all, we brought nothing with us when we came into the world, and we can’t take anything with us when we leave it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> So if we have enough food and clothing, let us be content. &mdash; 1 Timothy 6:7-8 NLT -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> For we have brought nothing into this world and so<sup style="color:#A8A8A8;">[a]</sup> we cannot take a single thing out either. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> But if we have food and shelter, we will be satisfied with that.<sup style="color:#A8A8A8;">[b]</sup> &mdash; 1 Timothy 6:7-8 NET

The path walked by most will lead them to total destruction, do not follow the crowd to hell. It is the one who pleads with others, who is mocked and laughed at, persecuted and maligned, slandered and ostracized for speaking the truth, this is one who you should listen closely to and heed their words, for the way is narrow and hard that leads to heaven and very few ever find it.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> “You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell<sup style="color:#A8A8A8;">[a]</sup> is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:13-14 NLT
