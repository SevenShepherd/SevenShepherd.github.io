<!-- It's common for a child, or one who is new to the faith, to wonder whether or not the hardships that they endure are the result of judgments against them for the sins that they have committed during their life. I'm writing this article to reassure you that this type of worry is unwarranted for all who are truly in Christ Jesus. Those with a genuine saving faith, a living faith. -->

It's not uncommon for a child or a newcomer to the faith to ponder whether the adversities they face are divine retribution for the past sins they have committed. In this article, I aim to provide assurance to those who have a true, living faith in Christ Jesus that such worries are unfounded. Genuine saving faith in Christ is sufficient to dispel such doubts and grant us the confidence to weather life's trials.

It's important to understand this and keep the inspired words of the Holy God within you, because the world is rife with the progeny of the devil, and the machinations of the wicked who act as pawns for Satan, loom large, threatening to assail us in times of adversity. 

Remember that in this world, all mortals will endure the vicissitudes of life, and are subject to the capriciousness of this unavoidable fate, regardless of any personal foibles or genuine remorse. Adversity may befall us, not due to any personal wrongdoing, even if one is sincere and remorseful. It is a mere consequence of the inexplicable and enigmatic ways of life that we all must endure. 

It is not because you made mistakes, and it is not over something you're truly [repentant (contrite)](https://bit.ly/3IchrbQ) of; no, it is simply the way life is for us all. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to remain steadfast in our faith and draw solace from the divine teachings to fortify ourselves against the travails of this life.

> ... For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and **he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike**. &mdash; [Matthew 5:45 NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:45&version=ESV;NLT)

Regardless of one's status, wealth, pride, or humility, mortality is an inescapable reality that we all share, and in the end, death treats everyone equally, reducing us to the same state as all other living beings, animal or otherwise. It is wise for the living to contemplate the inevitability of mortality rather than denying or dismissing it. 

<!-- for this awareness can inspire us to live with greater purpose, cherish each moment, and leave a meaningful legacy behind. -->

<!-- No matter who you are, how rich or poor, how prideful you have become, or how humble, you will all die like the animals do. It is better that the living consider this reality than to be naive and oblivious to it. -->

> For the fate of humans<sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3:19&version=NET" style="color:#A8A8A8;">[a]</a></sup> and the fate of animals are the same: As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath. There is no advantage for humans over animals, for both are fleeting. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 3:19 NET

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> One person dies in prosperity, completely comfortable and secure, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> the picture of good health, vigorous and fit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> Another person dies in bitter poverty, never having tasted the good life. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> **But both are buried in the same dust, both eaten by the same maggots.** &mdash; [Job 21:23-26 NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+21%3A23-26&version=EXB;NLT)

<!-- Remember that there are those out there who are both wise and skilled yet suffer poverty, there are those who spend many years in education but never amount to anything, as well as elite soldiers in the prime of their lives who are done in by an amateur; this is all by chance and we can never predict when hard times will come. Like an animal that is caught in a net, so you shall be when your time comes. -->

Ecclesiastes 9:11 reminds us that chance plays a significant role in the lives of all people. Despite their wisdom and expertise, some individuals may suffer from poverty, while others may dedicate years to education without achieving success. Even the strongest and most skilled soldiers can fall to an inexperienced adversary. These unpredictable and seemingly random events highlight the capricious nature of fate. Like an animal that is caught in a net, so you shall be when your time comes.

<!-- So remember not to be fooled by the pride of this life, and instead to build your rewards in heaven, rather than on earth where the moth and rust corrupts and decays all that you have worked for that counts for nothing before God, for what do we really profit from all the hard work that we do here on earth? (Ecc 1:3 NET) -->

<!-- Remember that earthly possessions are ephemeral and futile, like everything under the sun, they are subject to decay and destruction. Therefore, it is prudent to invest in heavenly treasures, which are imperishable and everlasting, rather than amassing worldly wealth that only offers transient pleasure. As stated in Ecclesiastes 1:3, "What profit is there for a person in all his labor that he undertakes beneath the sun?" Instead, follow the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 6:19-21, who advises storing up treasures in heaven, "where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal." -->

Ecclesiastes 1:3 warns us against placing too much value on earthly possessions, as they are temporary and subject to decay. It is easy to become prideful and put our faith in our own accomplishments and wealth, but we must remember that these things are fleeting and ultimately count for nothing in the eyes of God. Instead, we must shift our focus to building treasures in the eternal realm of heaven, where neither moth nor rust can inflict decay and corruption upon them. Despite our efforts, all that we accumulate on earth is ultimately meaningless and profitless. Let us not be deceived by the false promises of this world, but rather seek the eternal rewards that await us in the hereafter.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. &mdash; Matthew 6:19-21 KJV

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> After all, we brought nothing with us when we came into the world, and we can’t take anything with us when we leave it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> So if we have enough food and clothing, let us be content. &mdash; 1 Timothy 6:7-8 NLT -->

<!-- The path walked by the many will lead them to total destruction, do not follow the crowd on the wide path to hell, for narrow is the way, which leads unto life, and there will be few that find it. -->

Beware, for the road traveled by the multitude leads not to salvation, but to utter destruction. Do not be swayed by the flow of the masses towards the broad path that leads to eternal damnation. Rather, be resolute and steadfast, for the way that leads to life is narrow and fraught with hardship, and few indeed will find it.

<!-- It is the one who pleads with others, who is mocked and laughed at, persecuted and maligned, slandered and ostracized for speaking the truth, this is one who you should listen closely to and heed their words, -->

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> “You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate.
