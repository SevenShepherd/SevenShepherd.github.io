In my youth I destroyed myself with women, I understand your need little son, but that is not the way. I've lived this once before repenting, I've made love in the rain, in the night and the storm, in places I shouldn't have been and in the most exotic ways. I've experienced the so called story book escapades you think you want and it only leads to pain and suffering. I'm bringing you my experiences on what to look for and what to avoid from a biblical perspective so you don't destroy yourself.

<a name="love" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">1.1 The Definition Of Love</a>

If you're calling it love, and it's not this, it's not love my friend.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. &mdash; 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 NLT

<a name="woman" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">1.2 A Godly Woman Defined</a>

This is the rarest creature in the world. This should be what you're looking for. You need to learn to distinguish love from lust.

<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> Who can find a virtuous and capable wife?<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">**She is more precious than rubies.**</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> **Her husband can trust her,**<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">**and she will greatly enrich his life.**</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> She brings him good, not harm,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">all the days of her life.</span><br>
> 
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> She finds wool and flax<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and busily spins it.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> She is like a merchant‚Äôs ship,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">bringing her food from afar.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> She gets up before dawn to prepare breakfast for her household<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and plan the day‚Äôs work for her servant girls.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> She goes to inspect a field and buys it;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">with her earnings she plants a vineyard.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> She is energetic and strong,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">a hard worker.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> She makes sure her dealings are profitable;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">her lamp burns late into the night.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> Her hands are busy spinning thread,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">her fingers twisting fiber.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> She extends a helping hand to the poor<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and opens her arms to the needy.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> She has no fear of winter for her household,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">for everyone has warm clothes.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> She makes her own bedspreads.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">She dresses in fine linen and purple gowns.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> Her husband is well known at the city gates,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">where he sits with the other civic leaders.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> She makes belted linen garments<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and sashes to sell to the merchants.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> She is clothed with strength and dignity,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and she laughs without fear of the future.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> When she speaks, her words are wise,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and she gives instructions with kindness.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> She carefully watches everything in her household<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and suffers nothing from laziness.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> Her children stand and bless her.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">Her husband praises her:</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> ‚ÄúThere are many virtuous and capable women in the world,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">but you surpass them all!‚Äù</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">but a woman who fears the Lord will be greatly praised.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">31</sup> Reward her for all she has done.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">Let her deeds publicly declare her praise.</span>
>
&mdash; Proverbs 31:10-31 NLT

<a name="beware" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">1.4 Beware The Harlot</a>

True Righteousness and Wisdom Are Virtually Nonexistent

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> And I find more bitter than death<br>
The woman whose heart is snares and nets,<br>
Whose hands are fetters.<br>
He who pleases God shall escape from her,<br>
But the sinner shall be trapped by her.<br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> ‚ÄúHere is what I have found,‚Äù says the Preacher,<br>
‚ÄúAdding one thing to the other to find out the reason,<br><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> Which my soul still seeks but I cannot find:<br>
**One man among a thousand I have found,<br>
But a woman among all these I have not found.**<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> Truly, this only I have found:<br>
That God made man upright,<br>
But they have sought out many schemes.‚Äù<br>
>
&mdash; Ecclesiastes 7:26-29 NKJV

Admonitions and Warnings against Dangerous and Destructive Acts

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> To keep you from the evil woman,<br>
From the flattering tongue of a seductress.<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> Do not lust after her beauty in your heart,<br>
Nor let her allure you with her eyelids.<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> For by means of a harlot<br>
A man is reduced to a crust of bread;<br>
And an adulteress will prey upon his precious life.<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> Can a man take fire to his bosom,<br>
And his clothes not be burned?<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> Can one walk on hot coals,<br>
And his feet not be seared?<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> So is he who goes in to his neighbor‚Äôs wife;<br>
Whoever touches her shall not be innocent.

&mdash; Proverbs 6:24-29 NKJV

Flee from these destroyers, recognize them before it is too late!

> The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive [full of simpleness] and knows nothing. &mdash; Proverbs 9:13 ESV
