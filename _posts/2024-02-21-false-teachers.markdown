See [Christ's ‘Fruit-Bearing Metaphor’ Will Help You Defend The Church From Antinomianism And Legalism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#oden)

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> “Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> **You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way they act.** Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> A good tree can’t produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can’t produce good fruit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:YellowGreen;">people</span> by their actions.</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:15-20 NLT

This teaching isn't limited to false teachers only, as the fruit-bearing metaphor is applied to all the people of God. Even so far back as the Old Testament (Ps 1:3). Logically, false teachers create false disciples.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> “I am the true grapevine, and my Father is the gardener. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> He cuts off every branch of mine that doesn’t produce fruit, and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> You have already been pruned and purified by the message I have given you. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Remain in me, and I will remain in you. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">For a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine, and you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me.</span>
> 
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> “Yes, I am the vine; you are the branches. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Those who remain in me, and I in them, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:YellowGreen;">will</span> produce much fruit.</span> For apart from me you can do nothing. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown away like a useless branch and withers. Such branches are gathered into a pile to be burned. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> But if you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be granted! <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> When you produce much fruit, you are my true disciples. This brings great glory to my Father.
> 
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> “I have loved you even as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> When you obey my commandments, you remain in my love, just as I obey my Father’s commandments and remain in his love. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> I have told you these things so that you will be filled with my joy. Yes, your joy will overflow! <sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> This is my commandment: Love each other in the same way I have loved you. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> You are my friends if you do what I command. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> I no longer call you slaves, because a master doesn’t confide in his slaves. Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">You didn’t choose me. I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:YellowGreen;">lasting fruit</span></span>, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for, using my name. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> This is my command: Love each other.
>
&mdash; John 15:1-17 NLT

True believers will always be marked by the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal 5:22-23) and fakes will always demonstrate the works of the flesh (Gal 5:19-21).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">anyone living that sort of life <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">will not</span> inherit the Kingdom of God.</span>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">the Holy Spirit produces this kind of <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:YellowGreen;">fruit</span> in our lives</span>: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!

&mdash; Galatians 5:19-23 NLT.
