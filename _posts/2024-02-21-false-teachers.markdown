> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> “Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> **You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way they act.** Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> A good tree can’t produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can’t produce good fruit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:YellowGreen;">people</span> by their actions.</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:15-20 NLT
