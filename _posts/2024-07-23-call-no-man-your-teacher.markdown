<!-- This article was split into two. It was [**expanded upon here**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/), and [**summarized here**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/indoctrination/). -->

I recently wrote [an article on going systemless](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/) where I recommended the Bible and scholarly tools like lexicons for self-directed study or autodidactism. I showcased the most well vetted and educated leaders for Christ that do not push man-made systems:

> Pick up a Bible, pick up a lexicon it was made for English readers like you. You don't need some false teacher to spin the scriptures to you and indoctrinate you into some man-made system.

The Bible instructs us to *&ldquo;Call no man your teacher&rdquo;* for you have only one teacher, Christ Jesus, and all of you are equal as brothers (Mt 23:8-9). The Bible also says that He gave us teachers (Eph 4:11). This is not a contradiction, it's a paradox. The difference is that a true teacher from God will not be teaching [man-made systems](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/) or human wisdom, instead a teacher from God will teach scripture alone apart from any named man-made system.

> You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and do so correctly, for that is what I am. &mdash; John 13:13 NET

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">8</sup> “Don’t let anyone call you ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one teacher, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters. <sup style="font-weight:bold">9</sup> And don’t address anyone here on earth as ‘Father,’ for only God in heaven is your Father. &mdash; Matthew 23:8-9

Get rid of systematic theologians and those who attempt to interpret scripture for you and replace them with materials produced from [biblical language scholars](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/#Recommended-Materials) who actually know and are educated in the meaning of Koine Greek & Biblical Hebrew words.

- When you can speak on man-made teachings like all the different *'ologies* that come out of systematic theology, but you can't recollect a single parable from Christ. ***YOU ARE INDOCTRINATED***.
- If you hold to non-standard meanings of [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) or faith, and you think its only simple assent or mind change, ***YOU ARE INDOCTRINATED***. 

It's time for many of you to pull your heads out of the theological sand. It's time for you to give the Bible another chance. The world can **never** know God through human wisdom. Remember that theologians are not meant to interpret scripture for you—that right belongs to the Holy Spirit (1Jn 2:27; Jn 14:26;16:13; 2Pe 1:20-21; 1 Cor 2:12-14). Instead, open your Bible and fellowship with Christ.

> And we impart this in words **not taught by human wisdom** but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. 1Cor 2:13 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">20</sup> So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world’s brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. <sup style="font-weight:bold">21</sup> Since <span style="font-weight:bold">God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom</span>, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe. &mdash; 1 Cor 1:20-21

<!-- Not too long ago I wrote an article debunking [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), otherwise known as, the 80s *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* Movement. I explained how this dangerous movement cheapened the glorious grace of our God. After some thought, I realized just how menacing the false teachers propagating it are to the little hearts and minds of our children and I was compelled to warn the masses again against this dangerous deception. -->

<!-- Once you realize as I have, that every man-made system has failed, you will begin to understand that you have been lied to by charlatans posing as shepherds. -->

<!-- After observing the failure of every man-made system, I realized that systematic theologians are not necessary if you [**understand how to study the Bible yourself**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/). However, we do need [biblical language scholars](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/) to provide us with English translations and lexicons, as our manuscripts are in Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek, not our native tongue. Beyond this, the Bible tells us that **we have only one teacher, Christ Jesus**. So, the next time someone sends you videos from a questionable systematic theologian attempting to indoctrinate you into one of the *'isms*, remember that theologians are not meant to interpret scripture for you—that right belongs to the Holy Spirit (1Jn 2:27; Jn 14:26;16:13; 2Pe 1:20-21; 1 Cor 2:12-14). Instead, open your Bible and fellowship with Christ. -->

<!-- Pastors & shepherds (Mt 28:19-20; Mk 16:15) have been infinitely more accurate and necessary than any systematic theologian (1 Cor 1:20-21).

<!-- I recommend an accurate Bible that is closest to the original autograph, like ESV Study Bible (literal), NET Full Notes (optimal), NLT Filament (dynamic & meaning based). I then recommend The English-Greek Reverse Interlinear New Testament: English Standard Version (ESV) and the lexicon like BDAG, the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon to understand the meaning of the Greek words in the new testament, and HALOT to understand biblical hebrew in the old testament. -->

<!-- Get rid of systematic theologians and those who attempt to interpret scripture for you and replace them with [materials](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/#Recommended-Materials) produced from [biblical language scholars](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/hierarchy-of-authority/) & textual critics. This will bring you closest to God's word.
- BDAG & HALOT Lexicons (word study)
    - The world's most authoritative lexicons
- ESV Reverse Interlinear (word study)
- NET Full Notes (optimal)
    - World’s foremost biblical scholars
    - Non-sectarian and inter-denominational
    - Notes are an unparalleled treasure trove of textual criticism
    - My personal favorite (with the full notes only)

**You don't need systematic theologians. You just need the Bible and the Holy Spirit.** Systematic theology was a bad phase of a bygone era. Lexicons and textual criticism are all you need to bridge the language gap, and Christ is your only teacher. The world can **never** know God through human wisdom. Systematic Theologies that push specific *'isms* (Calvinism, Arminianism, [Chaferanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/free-grace-theology/), etc.) should be synonymous with indoctrination in this advanced day and age. -->
