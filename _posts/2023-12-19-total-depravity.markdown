Total depravity simply says, that man is not good enough to merit his own salvation. **Those who deny total depravity inadvertently claim they can merit their own salvation.** 

<!-- If you think about it, TULIP defends us from Catholicism. While I reject limited atonement (1Jn 2:2), and would challenge unconditional election (Romans 4:5), the rest is scriptural. -->

> We believe that all are sinners (Romans 3:23) and unable by human performance to earn, deserve, or merit salvation (Titus 3:5). We believe that the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), and that apart from God's grace, no one can be saved (Ephesians 2:8-9). We believe that none are righteous, **or capable of doing good** (Romans 3:10-12), and that **apart from the conviction and regeneration of the Holy Spirit, none can be saved** (John 1:12-13; 16:8-11; 1 Peter 1:23-25). **Mankind is clearly fallen and lost in sin.**

> **The concept of total depravity is consistent with Scripture**, but the doctrine of limited atonement, that Jesus did not die for the sins of the whole world, is clearly contrary to Biblical teaching. The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus died for everyone’s sins and that everyone is able to be saved **if they will repent and turn to Christ**. Limited atonement is a non-Biblical doctrine.

> 31\. ORIGINAL SIN
>
DEPRAVITY INFECTS EVERYONE

>> Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. Psalm 51:5

Scripture diagnoses sin as a universal deformity of human nature, found at every point in every person (1 Kgs. 8:46; Rom. 3:9–23; 7:18; 1 John 1:8–10). Both Testaments have names for it that display its ethical character as rebellion against God’s rule, missing the mark God set us to aim at, transgressing God’s law, disobeying God’s directives, offending God’s purity by defiling oneself, and incurring guilt before God the Judge. This moral deformity is dynamic: sin stands revealed as an energy of irrational, negative, and rebellious reaction to God’s call and command, a spirit of fighting God in order to play God. The root of sin is pride and enmity against God, the spirit seen in Adam’s first transgression; and sinful acts always have behind them thoughts, motives, and desires that one way or another express the wilful opposition of the fallen heart to God’s claims on our lives.
>
Sin may be comprehensively defined as lack of conformity to the law of
God in act, habit, attitude, outlook, disposition, motivation, and mode of existence. Scriptures that illustrate different aspects of sin include Jeremiah 17:9; Matthew 12:30–37; Mark 7:20–23; Romans 1:18 – 3:20; 7:7–25; 8:5– 8; 14:23 (Luther said that Paul wrote Romans to ‘magnify sin’); Galatians 5:16–21; Ephesians 2:1–3; 4:17–19; Hebrews 3:12; James 2:10–11; 1 John 3:4; 5:17. Flesh in Paul usually means a human being driven by sinful desire; the NIV renders these instances of the word as ‘sinful nature’. The particular faults and vices (i.e. forms and expressions of sin) that Scripture detects and denounces are too numerous to list here.
>
Original sin, meaning sin derived from our origin, is not a biblical
phrase (Augustine coined it), but it is one that brings into fruitful focus the reality of sin in our spiritual system. The assertion of original sin means not that sin belongs to human nature as God made it (God made mankind upright, Eccles. 7:29), nor that sin is involved in the processes of reproduction and birth (the uncleanness connected with menstruation, semen, and childbirth in Leviticus 12 and 15 was typical and ceremonial only, not moral and real), but that (a) sinfulness marks everyone from birth, and is there in the form of a motivationally twisted heart, prior to any actual sins; (b) this inner sinfulness is the root and source of all actual sins; (c) it derives to us in a real though mysterious way from Adam, our first representative before God. The assertion of original sin makes the point that we are not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we are sinners, born with a nature enslaved to sin.
>
**The phrase total depravity is commonly used to make explicit the implications of original sin. It signifies a corruption of our moral and spiritual nature that is total not in degree (for no-one is as bad as he or she might be) but in extent. It declares that no part of us is untouched by sin, and therefore no action of ours is as good as it should be, and consequently nothing in us or about us ever appears meritorious in God’s eyes. We cannot earn God’s favour, no matter what we do; unless grace saves us, we are lost.**
>
Total depravity entails total inability, that is, the state of not having it in oneself to respond to God and his Word in a sincere and wholehearted way (John 6:44; Rom. 8:7–8). Paul calls this unresponsiveness of the fallen heart a state of death (Eph. 2:1, 5; Col. 2:13), and the Westminster Confession says: ‘Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; so as a natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in sin, is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto’ (IX.3).

# Total Depravity v. Total Inability

Those who dislike the truth of total depravity may actually be thinking of total inability instead.

> 32. INABILITY
>
FALLEN HUMAN BEINGS ARE BOTH FREE AND ENSLAVED
>
>> The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it? Jeremiah 17:9
>
Clear thought about the fallen human condition requires a distinction between what for the past two centuries has been called free agency and what since the start of Christianity has been called free will. Augustine, Luther, Calvin, and others spoke of free will in two senses, the first trivial, the second important; but this was confusing, and it is better always to use free agency for their first sense.
>
Free agency is a mark of human beings as such. All humans are free agents in the sense that they make their own decisions as to what they will do, choosing as they please in the light of their sense of right and wrong and the inclinations they feel. Thus they are moral agents, answerable to God and each other for their voluntary choices. So was Adam, both before and after he sinned; so are we now, and so are the glorified saints who are confirmed in grace in such a sense that they no longer have it in them to sin. Inability to sin will be one of the delights and glories of heaven, but it will not terminate anyone’s humanness; glorified saints will still make choices in accordance with their nature, and those choices will not be any the less the product of human free agency just because they will always be good and right.
>
Free will, however, has been defined by Christian teachers from the second century on as the ability to choose all the moral options that a situation offers, and Augustine affirmed against Pelagius and most of the Greek Fathers that original sin has robbed us of free will in this sense. We have no natural ability to discern and choose God’s way because we have no natural inclination Godward; our hearts are in bondage to sin, and only the grace of regeneration can free us from that slavery. This, for substance, was what Paul taught in Romans 6:16–23; only the freed will (Paul says, the freed person) freely and heartily chooses righteousness. A permanent love of righteousness – that is, an inclination of heart to the way of living that pleases God – is one aspect of the freedom that Christ gives (John 8:34–36; Gal. 5:1, 13).
>
It is worth observing that will is an abstraction. My will is not a part of me which I choose to move or not to move, like my hand or my foot; it is precisely me choosing to act and then going into action. The truth about free agency, and about Christ freeing sin’s slave from sin’s dominion, can be expressed more clearly if the word will is dropped and each person says: I am the morally responsible free agency; I am the slave of sin whom Christ must liberate; I am the fallen being who only have it in me to choose against God till God renews my heart.

# GotQuestions.org

A nice [article on total depravity](https://www.gotquestions.org/total-depravity.html)

> The total depravity of man is seen throughout the Bible. Man’s heart is “deceitful and desperately wicked” (Jeremiah 17:9). The Bible also teaches us that man is born dead in transgression and sin (Psalm 51:5, Psalm 58:3, Ephesians 2:1-5). The Bible teaches that because unregenerate man is “dead in transgressions” (Ephesians 2:5), he is held captive by a love for sin (John 3:19; John 8:34) so that he will not seek God (Romans 3:10-11) because he loves the darkness (John 3:19) and does not understand the things of God (1 Corinthians 2:14). Therefore, men suppress the truth of God in unrighteousness (Romans 1:18) and continue to willfully live in sin. Because they are totally depraved, this sinful lifestyle seems right to men (Proverbs 14:12) so they reject the gospel of Christ as foolishness (1 Corinthians 1:18) and their mind is “hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is unable to do so” (Romans 8:7).

# Conclusion

I'd like to point out the following two verses, in the first, we have a good example of total depravity and our inability to save ourselves... 

> We are all infected and impure with sin. When we display our righteous deeds, they are nothing but filthy rags. Like autumn leaves, we wither and fall, and our sins sweep us away like the wind. &mdash; Isaiah 64:6 NLT

... and in the second verse, we see that Christians can live righteously, and are expected to practice righteousness. In these examples they are not speaking of merit, they're speaking of fruit.

> Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. &mdash; 1 John 3:7 ESV

> Some people may contradict our teaching, but **these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. These teachings promote a godly life.** 4 Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding... &mdash; 1 Timothy 6:3-4 NLT

The difference is, that every Christian understands that the righteousness they practice is not meritorious, it is for God's glory and a fruit of genuine saving faith.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. &mdash; Matthew 5:16 KJV
