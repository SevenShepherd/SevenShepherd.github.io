All Christians acknowledge the deity of Christ. Jesus is God made manifest in the flesh (Jn 1:1-3,14; Phil 2:5-8; Co 2:9) as prophesied (Is 9:6; Zec. 12:10). According to our *"most significant papyrus of the New Testament to be discovered so far,"* John reads:

This fact is even irrefutable by secular and Jewish scholarship when analyzing what the New Testament teaches in John 4:25-26.

Remember also, that [there is no savior but Yahweh](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/deity-18/). The bible reveals in Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1 that Jesus is our savior as well as our God, ergo, Jesus is Yahweh.

> JOHN‚ÄîNOTE ON 8:58 If there had been any uncertainty about Jesus‚Äô identity in other passages where he said, ‚ÄúI am‚Äù (e.g., 6:35; 9:5; 11:25), there was no confusion here because **Jesus is claiming to be the one who was alive before Abraham was, that is, more than 2,000 years earlier.** Jesus does not simply say, ‚ÄúBefore Abraham was, I was,‚Äù which would simply mean that he is more than 2,000 years old. Rather, **he uses the present tense ‚ÄúI am‚Äù in speaking of existence more than 2,000 years earlier, thus claiming a kind of transcendence over time that could only be true of God.** The words ‚ÄúI am‚Äù in Greek use the same expression (Eg≈ç eimi) found in the Septuagint in the first half of God‚Äôs self-identification in Ex. 3:14, ‚ÄúI AM WHO I AM.‚Äù **Jesus is thus claiming not only to be eternal but also to be the God who appeared to Moses at the burning bush.** His Jewish opponents understood his meaning immediately and they ‚Äúpicked up stones‚Äù to stone him to death for blasphemy (see John 8:59).

<!-- ![Five Solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg) -->

<!-- <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">II. Grace, Faith, & Christ Alone</span> -->

<sup>*See <a href="https://bit.ly/3xzIZms">Ordo Salutis</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/3IchrbQ">Repentance</a> for nuances.</sup>

Salvation comes from the Grace of God when we believed (Jn 3:16), we were justified through faith (Ro 5:1 ESV; Gal. 3:24 ESV), and faith was credited to us as righteousness (Ro 4:3,9,22; Jas 2:23; Gal. 3:9).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">not a result of works</span>, so that no one may boast. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus **for good works**, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. &mdash; Ephesians 2:8-10 ESV

The 16th century Protestant Reformation saw the development of the five latin phrases, known as the Five solas, as a response to heresies found in the Roman Catholic Church. 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2:21</sup> I do not nullify the grace of God; for **if justification<span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[a]</span> comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing**. ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5:4</sup> You who want to be justified by the law have **cut yourselves off from Christ**; you have fallen away from grace. &mdash; Gal. 2:21;5:4 NRSV. a. Galatians 2:21 Or righteousness

Roman Catholicism and Antinomianism are opposite sides of the same heretical coin. The former is works righteous and the latter abuses grace to nauseating and appalling levels of heresy. You need to acknowledge that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. This is why the protestant reformation happened. You also must not abuse the grace of our God (See Jude 4; Ro 6:1-2; 1Jn 2:3-6).

<!-- Roman Catholicism denies salvation by grace through faith alone in Christ alone. You need to acknowledge Grace. This is why the protestant reformation happened. The antinomianism & hyper-grace heresies are on the opposite end of extreme (See Jude 4; Ro 6:1-2; 1Jn 2:3-6). -->

<!-- (Latin *five solae*; Anglicized as *five solas*) -->
<!-- We're saved by Grace alone (*Sola Gratia*), through Faith alone (*Sola Fide*), in Christ alone (*Solus Christus*), according to scripture alone (*Sola Scriptura*), for the Glory of God alone (*Soli Deo Gloria*). -->

<!-- Justification by faith alone (*Sola fide*) has been a primary belief of Protestants since the time of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. -->

> Turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness - Abusing the doctrines of grace so as to give indulgence to corrupt and carnal propensities. That is, probably, they gave this form to their teaching, as **Antinomians** have often done, that by the gospel they were released from the obligations of the law, and might give indulgence to their sinful passions in order that grace might abound. **Antinomianism** began early in the world, and has always had a wide prevalence. The liability of the doctrines of grace to be thus abused was foreseen by Paul, and against such abuse he earnestly sought to guard the Christians of his time, Romans 6:1, following. -->

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. &mdash; Jude 1:4 ESV -->

These heresies can be avoided by adopting the Five Solas of the "historic Protestant" position which have been a sanctuary away from heresy for over 500 years. Evangelical theology also seems to be a bastion of safety as long as the nuances favor historic protestant theologies.

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">III. Death, Burial, And Bodily Resurrection</span>

<!-- ![Resurrection](/assets/images/resurrection.jpg) -->

The death, burial, and bodily resurrection of Christ Jesus is the Gospel message (1 Cor. 15:1-4). According to scripture, Jesus was raised physically in the very same body that he died in. Accursed is he that brings a contrary gospel, even if he be an angel of light (Gal. 1:8-9).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> And **if Christ has not been raised**, then our preaching is in vain and **your faith is in vain**. ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> And **if Christ has not been raised**, your faith is futile and **you are still in your sins**. &mdash; 1Co 15:14,17 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> **Jesus answered them, ‚ÄúDestroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.‚Äù** <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> The Jews then said, ‚ÄúIt has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?‚Äù <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> But **he was speaking about the temple of his body**. &mdash; John 2:19-21 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">36</sup> As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, ‚ÄúPeace to you!‚Äù <sup style="font-weight:bold;">37</sup> But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">38</sup> And he said to them, ‚ÄúWhy are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">39</sup> **See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.**‚Äù &mdash; Luke 24:36-39 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> Then he said to Thomas, ‚ÄúPut your finger here, and see my hands; and **put out your hand, and place it in my side**. Do not disbelieve, but **believe**.‚Äù <sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> Thomas answered him, **‚ÄúMy Lord and my God!‚Äù** &mdash; John 20:27 ESV

The Bible reveals that all three persons of the Trinity were involved in the resurrection. The Father (Ac 2:24; Ro 10:9; Gal. 1:1), The Son (Jn 2:19; 10:18), and the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:11).

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">IV. Monotheism</span>

Scripture speaks for itself. There is only one God.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> ‚ÄúHear, O Israel! <span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[a]</span>Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is one! &mdash; Deuteronomy 6:4 LSB

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> I am the LORD, and there is no other, **besides me there is no God**; I equip you, though you do not know me, &mdash; Isaiah 45:5 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">39</sup> ‚Äú‚ÄòSee now that I, even I, am he, and **there is no god beside me**; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. &mdash; Deuteronomy 32:39 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> **one God** and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. &mdash; Ephesians 4:6 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> This is what the LORD, Israel‚Äôs king, says, their Protector,<span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[a]</span> the LORD of Heaven‚Äôs Armies: ‚ÄúI am the first and I am the last, **there is no God but me**. &mdash; Isaiah 44:6 NET
