<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">I. Jesus Is God Made Manifest In The Flesh</span>

<sup>*See <a href="https://bit.ly/3HIQIoK">A Comprehensive Study On Jesus Deity</a></sup>

All Christians acknowledge the deity of Christ. Jesus is God made manifest in the flesh (Jn 1:1-3,14; Phil 2:5-8; Co 2:9) as prophesied (Is 9:6; Zec. 12:10). According to our *"most significant papyrus of the New Testament to be discovered so far,"* John reads:

<!-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_75" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;">The Most Significant Papyrus Of The New Testament</a>

All Christians acknowledge the deity of Christ. Jesus is God made manifest in the flesh (Jn 1:1-3,14) in the line of King David as prophesied (Is 9:6). [Papyrus 75 (𝔓75)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_75) *"The most significant" papyrus of the New Testament to be discovered so far,"* as well as [𝔓66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_66), further showcases this fact in John.  -->

According to the worlds foremost biblical scholars, Jesus declared Himself to be the Great “I AM” (John 8:56-59) the Old Testament name for God (Ex 3:14-16). He’s saying that He is the God of the Old Testament Yahweh! 

> *"I am! is **an explicit claim to deity**;"* The *"Jewish listeners understood his **claim to deity**"* and attempted to stone Jesus *"for what they considered blasphemy."* *"Jesus is thus claiming not only to be eternal but also to be **the God who appeared to Moses** at the burning bush."* &mdash; [NET Translators' Notes](https://amzn.to/3WLAgbr), [ESV Study Bible](https://amzn.to/3WsN0Uw)

This fact is even irrefutable by secular and Jewish scholarship when analyzing what the New Testament teaches in John 4:25-26.

[25+ of the world’s foremost biblical scholars](https://netbible.com/preface/) including Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies at Dallas Theological Seminary, and Dr. W. Hall Harris III editor of LEB and contributor of NASB '95. Highly educated men from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Columbia, Dallas, etc. have noted:

Jesus declared Himself to be the Great “I AM” (John 8:56-59), the Old Testament name for God (Ex 3:14-16). He’s saying that He is the God of the Old Testament Yahweh! The [ESV Study Bible](https://amzn.to/3WsN0Uw)
**200+ biblical scholars** from 9 countries, nearly 20 denominations, and 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities. Universities of Cambridge, London, Oxford, Dallas, etc. has concluded the very same thing:

> JOHN—NOTE ON 8:58 If there had been any uncertainty about Jesus’ identity in other passages where he said, “I am” (e.g., 6:35; 9:5; 11:25), there was no confusion here because **Jesus is claiming to be the one who was alive before Abraham was, that is, more than 2,000 years earlier.** Jesus does not simply say, “Before Abraham was, I was,” which would simply mean that he is more than 2,000 years old. Rather, **he uses the present tense “I am” in speaking of existence more than 2,000 years earlier, thus claiming a kind of transcendence over time that could only be true of God.** The words “I am” in Greek use the same expression (Egō eimi) found in the Septuagint in the first half of God’s self-identification in Ex. 3:14, “I AM WHO I AM.” **Jesus is thus claiming not only to be eternal but also to be the God who appeared to Moses at the burning bush.** His Jewish opponents understood his meaning immediately and they “picked up stones” to stone him to death for blasphemy (see John 8:59). See notes on 6:20; 8:24. -->

This fact is even irrefutable by secular and Jewish scholarship when analyzing what the New Testament teaches in John. As is evidenced by the study Bible from Oxford University Press. Over 50 years of students, and professors, relying on The New Oxford Annotated Bible as an unparalleled authority.

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">II. Salvation Is By Grace</span>

<sup>*See <a href="https://bit.ly/3xzIZms">Ordo Salutis</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/3IchrbQ">Repentance</a> for nuances.</sup>

Salvation comes from the Grace of God when we believed (Jn 3:16), we were justified through faith (Ro 5:1 ESV; Gal. 3:24 ESV), and faith was credited to us as righteousness (Ro 4:3,9,22; Jas 2:23; Gal. 3:9).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">not a result of works</span>, so that no one may boast. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus **for good works**, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. &mdash; Ephesians 2:8-10 ESV

The 16th century Protestant Reformation saw the development of the five latin phrases, known as the Five solas, as a response to heresies found in the Roman Catholic Church. 

<!-- > Roman Catholicism denies salvation by grace through faith alone in Christ alone. Therefore, Roman Catholicism is outside of Christianity. &mdash; Matt Slick (carm.org) -->


<!-- (Latin *five solae*; Anglicized as *five solas*) -->
<!-- We're saved by Grace alone (*Sola Gratia*), through Faith alone (*Sola Fide*), in Christ alone (*Solus Christus*), according to scripture alone (*Sola Scriptura*), for the Glory of God alone (*Soli Deo Gloria*). -->

<!-- Justification by faith alone (*Sola fide*) has been a primary belief of Protestants since the time of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. -->

<!-- |Five Solas||
|:-:|:-:|
|Saved by Grace alone<br>(*Sola Gratia*)|Eph 2:8-10; Ti 3:5; Gal. 2:21;5:4|
|Through Faith alone<br>(*Sola Fide*)|Ro 5:1 ESV; Gal. 3:24 ESV|
|In Christ alone<br>(*Solus Christus*)|Jn 14:6; 1Ti 2:5; Jn 1:1-3,14,18|
|According to Scripture alone<br>(*Sola Scriptura*)|1Co 4:6|
|For the Glory of God alone<br>(*Soli Deo Gloria*)|1Pe 2:24; Is 43:7| -->

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">III. Death, Burial, And Bodily Resurrection</span>

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. &mdash; 1Co 15:14,17 ESV

Jesus would be raised in the same body he died in.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?” <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> But he was speaking about the temple of his body. &mdash; John 2:19-21 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">36</sup> As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace to you!” <sup style="font-weight:bold;">37</sup> But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">38</sup> And he said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">39</sup> See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” &mdash; Luke 24:36-39 ESV

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> 27 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.” <sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” &mdash; John 20:27 ESV
