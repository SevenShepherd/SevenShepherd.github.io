<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_75" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:21px;">The Most Significant Papyrus Of The New Testament</a>

All Christians acknowledge the deity of Christ. Jesus is God made manifest in the flesh (Jn 1:1-3,14) in the line of King David as prophesied (Is 9:6). [Papyrus 75 (𝔓75)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_75) *"The most significant" papyrus of the New Testament to be discovered so far,"* as well as [𝔓66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_66), further showcases this fact in John.

[25+ of the world’s foremost biblical scholars](https://netbible.com/preface/) including Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies at Dallas Theological Seminary, and Dr. W. Hall Harris III editor of LEB and contributor of NASB '95. Highly educated men from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Columbia, Dallas, etc. have noted:

<!-- > 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced as he looked forward to my coming. He saw it and was glad.” 57 The people said, “You aren’t even fifty years old. How can you say you have seen Abraham?[a]” 58 Jesus answered, **“I tell you the truth, before Abraham was even born, I AM![b]”** 59 At that point they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus was hidden from them and left the Temple. &mdash; John 8:56-59 NLT -->

Jesus declared Himself to be the Great “I AM” (John 8:56-59), the Old Testament name for God (Ex 3:14-16). He’s saying that He is the God of the Old Testament Yahweh! The [ESV Study Bible](https://amzn.to/3WsN0Uw)
**200+ biblical scholars** from 9 countries, nearly 20 denominations, and 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities. Universities of Cambridge, London, Oxford, Dallas, etc. has concluded the very same thing:

> JOHN—NOTE ON 8:58 If there had been any uncertainty about Jesus’ identity in other passages where he said, “I am” (e.g., 6:35; 9:5; 11:25), there was no confusion here because **Jesus is claiming to be the one who was alive before Abraham was, that is, more than 2,000 years earlier.** Jesus does not simply say, “Before Abraham was, I was,” which would simply mean that he is more than 2,000 years old. Rather, **he uses the present tense “I am” in speaking of existence more than 2,000 years earlier, thus claiming a kind of transcendence over time that could only be true of God.** The words “I am” in Greek use the same expression (Egō eimi) found in the Septuagint in the first half of God’s self-identification in Ex. 3:14, “I AM WHO I AM.” **Jesus is thus claiming not only to be eternal but also to be the God who appeared to Moses at the burning bush.** His Jewish opponents understood his meaning immediately and they “picked up stones” to stone him to death for blasphemy (see John 8:59). See notes on 6:20; 8:24.

This fact is even irrefutable by secular and Jewish scholarship when analyzing what the New Testament teaches in John. As is evidenced by the study Bible from Oxford University Press. Over 50 years of students, and professors, relying on The New Oxford Annotated Bible as an unparalleled authority.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> The woman said to him, ‘I know that Messiah is coming’ (who is called Christ). ‘When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.’ <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> **Jesus said to her, ‘I am** he,<span style="color:#A7A7A7;">[**Gk I am**]</span> the one who is speaking to you.’ ... &mdash; John 4:25-26 NOAB (NRSV)
>
**58: I am, see 4.26n**; 4.26: I am (see note c) **implying a theophany** as in Ex 3.14; Isa 41.4; 43.10; 46.4. This is the first announcement by
Jesus himself of his identity as Messiah.

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;color:Black;">II. Salvation Is By Grace</span>

<sup>*See <a href="https://bit.ly/3xzIZms">Ordo Salutis</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/3IchrbQ">Repentance</a> for nuances.</sup>

The 16th century Protestant Reformation saw the development of the five latin phrases known as the Five solas (Latin *five solae*; Anglicized as *five solas*), which were developed as a response to heresies found in the Roman Catholic Church. Justification by faith alone (*Sola fide*) has been a primary belief of Protestants since the time of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation.

|Five Solas||
|:-:|:-:|
|Scripture alone<br>(*Sola Scriptura*)|1Co 4:6|
|Christ alone<br>(*Solus Christus*)|Jn 14:6; 1Ti 2:5; Jn 1:1-3,14,18|
|Grace alone<br>(*Sola Gratia*)|Eph 2:8-9; Ti 3:5|
|Faith alone<br>(*Sola Fide*)|Ro 5:1 ESV; Gal. 3:24 ESV|
|Glory of God alone<br>(*Soli Deo Gloria*)|1Pe 2:24; Is 43:7|
