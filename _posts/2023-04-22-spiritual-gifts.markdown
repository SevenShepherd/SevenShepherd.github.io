<span style="font-size:1.6em;">‚ö†Ô∏è Under Construction</span>

This article is under construction and what you see at the moment is just an idea or outline of what I might want this article to become. It is by no means complete, let alone even begun. Refresh weekly for updates.

> &ldquo;I am a charismatic Baptist&mdash;just like Calvin, Luther, Zwingli, Knox&mdash;all the reformers. I believe the gifts of the Spirit are here until Jesus Christ returns. **I am a true Charismatic.** I am not a Pentecostal Charismatic. I have never spoken in tongues but **I am willing to receive from the Holy Spirit any gift He wants to give me, and anybody that is not, is an <span style="color:purple;">extremely foolish Christian</span>.**&rdquo; &mdash; <a href="#martin">Dr. Walter Martin</a>

<!-- <sup><a href="#martin">1</a></sup> -->

<!-- As Martin points out, the strange logic of cessationists have led to numerous belligerent and embarrassing rants over the years. These people are of course extremely misguided, fringe, and possibly committing self-harm in their walk with Christ. We should be either soft-cessationist or open but cautious continuationists. -->

<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:1.6em;">Balance</span>

> &ldquo;As strange as it may seem I am convinced today that the dead orthodoxy of many churches could be **enhanced by the gifts of the holy spirit** in operation within the body ... there must be a middle position between the pentecostals with their overemphasis on experience and the **fundamentalists** who in their quest to be right in too many cases **have become dead right**.&rdquo; &mdash; <a href="#smith">Chuck Smith</a>

<!-- Reformed theologians are perhaps the most intelligent and educated group of theologians throughout history, but one must remember that it brings God pleasure to conceal a matter from scholars and philosophers. -->

<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:1.6em;">Qualifications Of An Apostle</span>

> The two qualifications for being an apostle were (**1**) having seen Jesus after his resurrection with one's own eyes (thus, being an "eye-witness of the resurrection") and (**2**) having been specifically commissioned by Christ as his apostle. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag) (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D. & M.A., Westminister; B.A., Harvard), [Systematic Theology, 2nd ed.](https://amzn.to/40QF8z5) p. 1117.


<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:1.6em;">God Uses Terrifying Visions</span>

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it. <span style="font-weight:bold;"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> then he opens the ears of men and terrifies<sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2033%3A14-28&version=ESV;NET;EXB">[a]</a></sup> them with warnings,</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man; <sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> ‚ÄúMan is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> and he is merciful to him, and says, ‚ÄòDeliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom; <sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor‚Äô; <span style="font-weight:bold;"><sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> then man<sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2033%3A14-28&version=ESV;NET;EXB">[b]</a></sup> prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> He sings before men and says: ‚ÄòI sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.‚Äô &mdash; [Job 33:14-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2033%3A14-28&version=ESV;NET;EXB), Elihu Disagrees With Job‚Äôs View of God.


<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:1.6em;">Recommended Teachers With Sound Doctrine</span>

Aside from those quoted in this article, here is a list of those with sound doctrine and a non-cessationist stance, which is in my humble opinion, representative of the correct and narrow path. These teachers are first class.

<!-- For those who would like to read a healthy critique of the charismatic movement, here is a list of those with sound doctrine and a cessationist stance, who are not of a belligerent spirit of persecution against the workings of the Holy Spirit.

> That he [J. I. Packer] is a cessationist is beyond question. But the wise, gentle, biblical, and loving way in which he responds to those in the charismatic movement is a model of Christian maturity and depth of character. &mdash; Sam Storms (Ph.D., University of Texas)
