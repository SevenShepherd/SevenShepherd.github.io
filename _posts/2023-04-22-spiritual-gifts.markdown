<span style="font-size:1.6em;">‚ö†Ô∏è Under Construction</span>

This article is under construction and what you see at the moment is just an idea or outline of what I might want this article to become. It is by no means complete, let alone even begun. Refresh weekly for updates.

> &ldquo;I am a charismatic Baptist&mdash;just like Calvin, Luther, Zwingli, Knox&mdash;all the reformers. I believe the gifts of the Spirit are here until Jesus Christ returns. **I am a true Charismatic.** I am not a Pentecostal Charismatic. I have never spoken in tongues but **I am willing to receive from the Holy Spirit any gift He wants to give me, and anybody that is not, is an <span style="color:purple;">extremely foolish Christian</span>.**&rdquo; &mdash; <a href="#martin">Dr. Walter Martin</a>

<!-- <sup><a href="#martin">1</a></sup> -->

<!-- As Martin points out, the strange logic of cessationists have led to numerous belligerent and embarrassing rants over the years. These people are of course extremely misguided, fringe, and possibly committing self-harm in their walk with Christ. We should be either soft-cessationist or open but cautious continuationists. -->

<a name="11" href="#contents" style="font-size:2em;">The Genuine Charismatic</a>

> &ldquo;As strange as it may seem I am convinced today that the dead orthodoxy of many churches could be **enhanced by the gifts of the holy spirit** in operation within the body ... there must be a middle position between the pentecostals with their overemphasis on experience and the **fundamentalists** who in their quest to be right in too many cases **have become dead right**.&rdquo; &mdash; <a href="#smith">Chuck Smith</a>

<!-- Reformed theologians are perhaps the most intelligent and educated group of theologians throughout history, but one must remember that it brings God pleasure to conceal a matter from scholars and philosophers. -->

<a name="12" href="#contents" style="font-size:2em;">What Is A Spiritual Gift</a>

> A spiritual gift is any ability that is empowered by the Holy Spirit and **used in any ministry** of the church. &mdash; Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D. & M.A., Westminister; B.A., Harvard)

- Acts 2:38-39 & John 14:17 (indwells) (The Gift of the holy spirit is for all)
        > 8 Then Peter said to them, ‚ÄúRepent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the [a]remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.‚Äù
        > 17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you. 

- 1 Corinthians 12:1-4 (The Holy Spirit is where Gifts of the Spirit originate or are manifested)
        > 12 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant: 2 You know that[a] you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb[b] idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus [c]accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.
        >
        4 There are [d]diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

<a name="14" href="#contents" style="font-size:2em;">Qualifications Of An Apostle</a>

> The two qualifications for being an apostle were (**1**) having seen Jesus after his resurrection with one's own eyes (thus, being an "eye-witness of the resurrection") and (**2**) having been specifically commissioned by Christ as his apostle. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag) (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D. & M.A., Westminister; B.A., Harvard), [Systematic Theology, 2nd ed.](https://amzn.to/40QF8z5) p. 1117.


<a name="15" href="#contents" style="font-size:2em;">Only The Unlearned Mock The Gifts</a>

> Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in **those who are uninformed or unbelievers**, will they not **say that you are [a]out of your mind**? &mdash; 1 Corinthians 14:23 (Only unbelievers & unlearned men mock the gifts)

> Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies. Test all things; hold fast what is good. &mdash; 1 Thessalonians 5:19-21 (Consistent with the Bible)

<a name="16" href="#contents" style="font-size:2em;">Can The Devil Imitate Speaking In Tongues?</a>

> 31 [L‚ÄØFor] You can all prophesy one after the other. In this way all the people can be taught and encouraged. 32 The spirits of prophets are ¬∑under the control of [subject to] the prophets themselves [C‚ÄØ**unlike in pagan religions, where a spirit would seize control of a speaker, causing frenzy, mania or ecstasy**]. 33 [L‚ÄØFor] God is not a God of ¬∑confusion [disorder] but a God of peace. &mdash; 1 Corinthians 14:31-33 (Which is the true tounges)

> 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, **self-control**; against such things there is no law. &mdash; Galatians 5:22-23

<a name="16" href="#contents" style="font-size:2em;">Cessationism Isn't Historical</a>

- Continuationist (Unique Perspective)
    - Acts 21:9 (Not all prophets have a "canonical authority")
        > Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
    - 1 Corinthians 14:29, 1 Thessalonians 5:20, Deuteronomy 18:21-22 (Commanded to Test Prophecies Implying they are present and some could be true and others false)
        > Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge. 
     

    - All the early church fathers disagree with cessationism
        - **Justin Martyr** (d.165) in his Dialogue with Trypho makes the comment: 'For the prophetical gifts remain with us, even to the present time.'
        - **Irenaeus** (d.202) was a pupil of Polycarp, who was a disciple of the apostle John.
        - **Origen** (AD 185‚Äì253). He professed to have been an eye-witness to many instances of exorcism, healing, and prophecy, although he refused, to record the details lest he should rouse the laughter and scorn of the unbeliever.
        - **Chrysostom** (d.407) ‚Äì writing on 1 Corinthians and the gift of tongues said, "This whole place is very obscure; but the obscurity is produced by our ignorance of the facts referred to and by their cessation, being such as then used to occur but now no longer take place. And why do they not happen now? Why look now, the cause too of the obscurity hath produced us again another question: namely, why did they then happen, and now do so no more?". (AD 347‚Äì407)[18]
        - **Augustine** (d.430) ‚Äì In a homily on the 1st Epistle of John, Augustine commented that speaking in tongues was a miracle suitable for the early church, but that it was no longer evident in his own time.[19] In chapters 8 and 9 of Book XXII of his City of God, written circa AD 415, Augustine noted that miracles in his day were not as spectacular or noteworthy as those at the dawn of Christianity, but that they continued to take place.[20]

<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:1.6em;">Recommended Teachers With Sound Doctrine</span>

Aside from those quoted in this article, here is a list of those with sound doctrine and a non-cessationist stance, which is in my humble opinion, representative of the correct and narrow path. These teachers are first class.

> That he [J. I. Packer] is a cessationist is beyond question. But the wise, gentle, biblical, and loving way in which he responds to those in the charismatic movement is a model of Christian maturity and depth of character. &mdash; Sam Storms (Ph.D., University of Texas)
