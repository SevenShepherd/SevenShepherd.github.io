<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">I. The First Heaven, The Atmospheric Heaven</span>

![Atmospheric Heaven](/assets/images/heavens/atmosphere.jpg)

The *First Heaven*&mdash;also known as the *Atmospheric Heaven*&mdash;is composed of six different layers (troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, ionosphere, and exosphere) representing the first 621 miles of space known as the sky.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:24px;">Troposphere</span>

- The first layer of the atmosphere is known as the [troposphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/troposphere/en/), which is the innermost layer of Earth’s atmosphere. “Tropos” means change and gets its name from the weather that is constantly changing. The troposphere is between 5 and 9 miles thick and contains the air we breathe, the clouds in the sky, the wind you feel on your face, and the many variety of birds. 

    <!-- This layer contains three-quarters of the mass of the entire atmosphere. The air here is 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. The last 1% is made of argon, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. -->

    > Beside them <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the birds of the heavens</span> dwell; they sing among the branches. &mdash; Psalm 104:12

    <!-- The hydrological cycle is mentioned in Acts 14:17 where God uses the atmospheric heaven to provide good things to all people. God also uses this layer to provide nourishment to the earth in Deut. 11:11; Is 55:10; Ps 147:8. It has also been used as make mankind turn from their sins in 1 Kings 8:35. -->

    God gave us the hydrological cycle to provide good things to all people.

    > “Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">rains from heaven</span> and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.” &mdash; Acts 14:17
    
    As well as nourishment for the earth. <!--Deut. 11:11; Is 55:10; Ps 147:8-->

    > “But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the rain from heaven</span>,” &mdash; Deut. 11:11
    <!-- “For as <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the rain and the snow come down from heaven</span> and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, -->
    >
    “<span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">He covers the heavens with clouds</span>; he prepares rain for the earth; he makes grass grow on the hills.” &mdash; Ps 147:8

    The troposphere has been used to implement punishment and cleanse the earth of corruption. It has also been used to make mankind turn from their sins. 

    > “... the fountains of the great deep split open, and <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the floodgates of the sky</span> were opened. 12 Then the rain came upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.” &mdash; Genesis 7:11-12
    >
    “The fountains of the deep and the windows of <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the heavens</span> were closed, <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the rain from the heavens</span> was restrained,” &mdash; Genesis 8:2
    
    > “<span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">When heaven is shut up and there is no rain</span> because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict them,” &mdash; 1 Kings 8:35

The [stratosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/stratosphere/en/), [mesosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/mesosphere/en/), [thermosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/thermosphere/en/), [ionosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/ionosphere/en/), and [exosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/exosphere/en/) make up the remaining layers of the the earths [atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/), and therefore form the entirety of the atmospheric heaven.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">II. The Second Heaven, The Stellar Heaven</span>

![Stellar Heaven](/assets/images/heavens/universe.jpg)

The *Second Heaven*&mdash;also known as the *Stellar Heaven*&mdash;is comprised of moons, planets, stars (like our sun), solar systems, star clusters, galaxies, galaxy clusters, sheets, walls, supercluster complexes, and filaments. The entire universe or universes. This includes everything that composes spacetime.

> When I see <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars</span>, which You have established; &mdash; [Psalm 8:3 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible)](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Ps.+8%3A3)

The lights in the *Stellar Heaven* separate the day from night and exist for signs and seasons. 

> Then God said, “<span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night</span>, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; **15** and <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth”</span>; and it was so. **16** So God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and also the stars. **17** And <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth</span>, &mdash; [Gen 1:14-17 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible)](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Gen+1%3A14-17)

The *Second Heaven* also reveals the glory of God. 

> <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">The heavens ·declare</span> <span style="color:#993399;">[recount; narrate]</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">the glory</span> <span style="color:#993399;">[<sup>C</sup> the manifest presence]</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">of God</span>, and the ·skies <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[firmament; dome; Gen. 1:6]</span> ·announce <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[speak out]</span> ·what his hands have made <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> the works of his hands]</span>. **2** Day after day they ·tell the story <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> bubble/pour forth speech]</span>; night after night they ·tell it again <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> declare knowledge]</span>. **3** They have no speech or words; they have no voice to be heard. **4** But their ·message <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> line]</span> goes out through all the world; their words go ·everywhere on <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> to the ends of the]</span> earth. ·The sky <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[Heaven; <sup>L</sup> In them]</span> is like a ·home <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> tent]</span> for the sun &mdash; Ps. 19:1-4 EXB (Expanded Bible)

<!-- In addition, the cosmic bodies of the planetary heaven testify to the enduring commitment of God to the nation of Israel. Thus, immediately after mentioning the sun, moon, and stars in Jeremiah 31:35, God declares, “If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I
will cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done, declares
the LORD” (31:37). Gen. 15:5; -->

The *Stellar Heaven* will play a major role in the coming tribulation period, The shaking of the *Second Heaven* during the tribulation period reveals that God’s wrath has come on the unbelieving world of that time (Rev. 6:12-17).

> “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken</span>. &mdash; Matthew 24:29 ESV (English Standard Version); See [Is. 13:10; 34:4; cf. Ezek. 32:7–8; Joel 2:10, 31].

<span style="font-size:14px;">\*I'm a little disappointed that the [LSB](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+24%3A29) says "the sky" instead of "heaven". Kudos to the [ESV, NET, and EXB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A29&version=ESV;NET;EXB) for the more literal translation.</span>

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">III. The Third Heaven, The Heaven of God’s Presence</span>

![Third Heaven](/assets/images/heavens/higherspace.jpg)

The *Third Heaven* is the heaven of God’s presence. This is likely an extra-dimensional plane of existence above and beyond the spatiotemporal limitations of human understanding. 

<!-- > He who descended is the one who also ascended <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#daa520;">far above all the heavens</span>, that he might fill all things.) &mdash; Ephesians 4:10 ESV (English Standard Version) -->

> He alone possesses immortality and **lives in unapproachable light**, [whom no human has ever seen or is able to see](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/deity-37/). To him be honor and eternal power! Amen. &mdash; [1 Timothy 6:16 NET (New English Translation)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+6%3A16&version=NET)

Jesus is in a heaven beyond other heavens.

> For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#daa520;">exalted above the heavens</span>; &mdash; [Hebrews 7:26 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible)](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Hebrews+7%3A26) See Heb. 4:14

The *Third Heaven* is the command post and center of operation for God's universal kingdom, from which he rules over everything in the universe.

> Yahweh has established His throne in <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#daa520;">the heavens</span>, And His kingdom rules over all. &mdash; Ps. 103:19 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible); See Ps. 93:1; 96:10; 99:1

God’s throne resides in heaven, and it is there that he is worshiped. [Revelation chapter 4](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=rev+4) presents this in detail.

<!-- Yahweh reigns, let the peoples tremble; He sits enthroned above the cherubim, let the earth quake! &mdash; Ps. 99:1 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible) -->

NET Translator Notes (Literal)

> **a**. <u>2 Corinthians 12:4 NET</u> sn In the NT, paradise is mentioned three times. In Luke 23:43 NET it refers to the <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#BC3823;">abode of the righteous dead</span>. In Rev 2:7 NET it refers to the restoration of Edenic paradise predicted in Isa 51:3 NET and Ezek 36:35 NET. The reference here in 2 Cor 12:4 NET <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#daa520;">is probably to be translated as parallel to the mention of the “third heaven” in v. 2.</span> Assuming that <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the “first heaven” would be atmospheric heaven (the sky)</span> and <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">“second heaven” the more distant stars and planets</span>, <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#daa520;">“third heaven” would refer to the place where God dwells.</span> This is much more likely than some variation on the seven heavens mentioned in the pseudepigraphic book 2 Enoch and in other nonbiblical and rabbinic works.<br>
> **b**. <u>2 Corinthians 12:4 NET</u> tn Or “things that cannot be put into words.”<br>
> **c**. <u>2 Corinthians 12:4 NET</u> tn Grk “a man.”

![Underworld](/assets/images/heavens/third_heaven.gif)

The term “[Abraham’s bosom](https://www.gotquestions.org/Abrahams-bosom.html)” is found only once in the New Testament, in [the story of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31)](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Luke+16%3A19-31). This place is also referred to as the *abode of the righteous dead*, it is a place of comfort to which the angels carried Lazarus upon his death. *Abraham's Bosom*, or less traditionally and more literally, *Abraham's Side* is equivalent to *Paradise*.

NET Translator Notes

> **b**. <u>Luke 16:22</u> tn Grk “to <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#BC3823;">Abraham’s bosom</span>.” The phrase “carried by the angels to <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#BC3823;">Abraham’s bosom</span>” describes being gathered to the fathers and is a way to refer to heaven (Gen 15:15; 47:30; Deut 31:16).<br>
**e**. <u>Luke 16:23</u> sn The Greek term Hades stands for the Hebrew concept of Sheol. This is where the dead were gathered (Pss 16:10; 86:13). In the NT Hades sometimes has an additional negative force of awaiting judgment (Rev 20:13).<br>
**f**. <u>Luke 16:23</u> sn Hades is a place of torment, especially as one knows that he is separated from God.<br>
**h**. <u>Luke 16:23</u> tn Grk “in his bosom,” the same phrase used in 16:22. This idiom refers to heaven and/or participation in the eschatological banquet. An appropriate modern equivalent is “at <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#BC3823;">Abraham’s side.</span>”

*Abraham's Bosom* was the comfort side of Hades before it was evacuated after Christ's crucifixion and resurrection when Christ descended into the lower parts of the earth and ascended, taking His people waiting there to the *Third Heaven* (where all saints presently go at death) (Eph 4:8-10 NKJV; 2 Cor 12:2-4)

> So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. 7 For we walk by faith, not by sight. 8 We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be **absent from the body and to be present with the Lord**. &mdash; 2 Corinthians 5:6-8 NKJV (New King James Version)
