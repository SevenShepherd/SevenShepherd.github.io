<!-- Jn 14:1-6

[Third](https://www.gotquestions.org/Paul-third-heaven.html)
[The short answer to this question is, “heaven is where God is.”](https://www.gotquestions.org/where-is-Heaven.html)

The idea that more than one type of “heaven” exists is confirmed in Hebrews 7:26, which says that Jesus, our High Priest, is “exalted above the heavens”; in other words, Jesus is in a heaven beyond other heavens. Heb. 4:14 -->

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">I. The First Heaven, The Atmospheric Heaven</span>

![Atmospheric Heaven](/assets/images/heavens/atmosphere.jpg)

The *First Heaven*&mdash;also known as the *Atmospheric Heaven*&mdash;is composed of six different layers (troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, ionosphere, and exosphere) representing the first 621 miles of space known as the sky.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:24px;">Troposphere</span>

- The first layer of the atmosphere is known as the [troposphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/troposphere/en/), which is the innermost layer of Earth’s atmosphere. “Tropos” means change and gets its name from the weather that is constantly changing. The troposphere is between 5 and 9 miles thick and contains the air we breathe, the clouds in the sky, the wind you feel on your face, and the many variety of birds. 

    <!-- This layer contains three-quarters of the mass of the entire atmosphere. The air here is 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. The last 1% is made of argon, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. -->

    > Beside them <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the birds of the heavens</span> dwell; they sing among the branches. &mdash; Psalm 104:12

    <!-- The hydrological cycle is mentioned in Acts 14:17 where God uses the atmospheric heaven to provide good things to all people. God also uses this layer to provide nourishment to the earth in Deut. 11:11; Is 55:10; Ps 147:8. It has also been used as make mankind turn from their sins in 1 Kings 8:35. -->

    God gave us the hydrological cycle to provide good things to all people.

    > “Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">rains from heaven</span> and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.” &mdash; Acts 14:17
    
    As well as nourishment for the earth. <!--Deut. 11:11; Is 55:10; Ps 147:8-->

    > “But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the rain from heaven</span>,” &mdash; Deut. 11:11
    <!-- “For as <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the rain and the snow come down from heaven</span> and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, -->
    >
    “<span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">He covers the heavens with clouds</span>; he prepares rain for the earth; he makes grass grow on the hills.” &mdash; Ps 147:8

    The troposphere has been used to implement punishment and cleanse the earth of corruption. It has also been used to make mankind turn from their sins. 

    > “... the fountains of the great deep split open, and <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the floodgates of the sky</span> were opened. 12 Then the rain came upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.” &mdash; Genesis 7:11-12
    >
    “The fountains of the deep and the windows of <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the heavens</span> were closed, <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the rain from the heavens</span> was restrained,” &mdash; Genesis 8:2
    
    > “<span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">When heaven is shut up and there is no rain</span> because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict them,” &mdash; 1 Kings 8:35

The [stratosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/stratosphere/en/), [mesosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/mesosphere/en/), [thermosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/thermosphere/en/), [ionosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/ionosphere/en/), and [exosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/exosphere/en/) make up the remaining layers of the the earths [atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/), and therefore form the entirety of the atmospheric heaven.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">II. The Second Heaven, The Stellar Heaven</span>

![Stellar Heaven](/assets/images/heavens/universe.jpg)

The *Second Heaven*&mdash;also known as the *Stellar Heaven*&mdash;is comprised of moons, planets, stars (like our sun), solar systems, star clusters, galaxies, galaxy clusters, sheets, walls, supercluster complexes, and filaments. The entire universe or universes. This includes everything that composes spacetime.

> When I see <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars</span>, which You have established; &mdash; [Psalm 8:3 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible)](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Ps.+8%3A3)

The lights in the *Stellar Heaven* separate the day from night and exist for signs and seasons. 

> Then God said, “<span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night</span>, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; **15** and <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth”</span>; and it was so. **16** So God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and also the stars. **17** And <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth</span>, &mdash; [Gen 1:14-17 LSB (Legacy Standard Bible)](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Gen+1%3A14-17)

The *Second Heaven* also reveals the glory of God. 

> <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">The heavens ·declare</span> <span style="color:#993399;">[recount; narrate]</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">the glory</span> <span style="color:#993399;">[<sup>C</sup> the manifest presence]</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">of God</span>, and the ·skies <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[firmament; dome; Gen. 1:6]</span> ·announce <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[speak out]</span> ·what his hands have made <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> the works of his hands]</span>. **2** Day after day they ·tell the story <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> bubble/pour forth speech]</span>; night after night they ·tell it again <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> declare knowledge]</span>. **3** They have no speech or words; they have no voice to be heard. **4** But their ·message <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> line]</span> goes out through all the world; their words go ·everywhere on <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> to the ends of the]</span> earth. ·The sky <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[Heaven; <sup>L</sup> In them]</span> is like a ·home <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[<sup>L</sup> tent]</span> for the sun &mdash; Ps. 19:1-4 EXB (Expanded Bible)

<!-- In addition, the cosmic bodies of the planetary heaven testify to the enduring commitment of God to the nation of Israel. Thus, immediately after mentioning the sun, moon, and stars in Jeremiah 31:35, God declares, “If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I
will cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done, declares
the LORD” (31:37). Gen. 15:5; -->

The *Stellar Heaven* will play a major role in the coming tribulation period, The shaking of the *Second Heaven* during the tribulation period reveals that God’s wrath has come on the unbelieving world of that time (Rev. 6:12-17).

> “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken</span>. &mdash; Matthew 24:29 ESV (English Standard Version); See [Is. 13:10; 34:4; cf. Ezek. 32:7–8; Joel 2:10, 31].

<span style="font-size:14px;">\*I'm a little disappointed that the [LSB](https://read.lsbible.org/?q=Matthew+24%3A29) says "the sky" instead of "heaven". Kudos to the [ESV, NET, and EXB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A29&version=ESV;NET;EXB) for the more literal translation.</span>

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:34px;">III. The Third Heaven, The Heaven of God’s Presence</span>

![Third Heaven](/assets/images/heavens/thirdheaven.gif)

The third heaven&mdash;or paradise&mdash;is the heaven of God’s presence. This is likely the extra-dimensional and hyperspatial dimensions above and beyond the spatiotemporal limitations of mankind.

> He alone possesses immortality and **lives in unapproachable light**, whom no human has ever seen or is able to see. To him be honor and eternal power! Amen. &mdash; [1 Timothy 6:16 NET (New English Translation)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+6%3A16&version=NET)

    **NET Translator Notes (Literal)**
    >
    **a**. <u>2 Corinthians 12:4 NET</u> sn In the NT, paradise is mentioned three times. In Luke 23:43 NET it refers to the abode of the righteous dead. In Rev 2:7 NET it refers to the restoration of Edenic paradise predicted in Isa 51:3 NET and Ezek 36:35 NET. The reference here in 2 Cor 12:4 NET <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#daa520;">is probably to be translated as parallel to the mention of the “third heaven” in v. 2.</span> Assuming that <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#0099cc;">the “first heaven” would be atmospheric heaven (the sky)</span> and <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#993399;">“second heaven” the more distant stars and planets</span>, <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#daa520;">“third heaven” would refer to the place where God dwells.</span> This is much more likely than some variation on the seven heavens mentioned in the pseudepigraphic book 2 Enoch and in other nonbiblical and rabbinic works.<br>
    > **b**. <u>2 Corinthians 12:4 NET</u> tn Or “things that cannot be put into words.”<br>
    > **c**. <u>2 Corinthians 12:4 NET</u> tn Grk “a man.”

    > I was caught up to the <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:#daa520;">third heaven</span> fourteen years ago. Whether I was in my body or out of my body, I don’t know—only God knows. 3 Yes, only God knows whether I was in my body or outside my body. But I do know 4 that I was caught up to paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be expressed in words, things no human is allowed to tell. &mdash; [2 Cor 12:2 NLT (New Living Translation)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Cor+12%3A2-4&version=NLT)
