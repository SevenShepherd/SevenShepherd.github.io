Ordo salutis is a latin phrase for “The Order of Salvation” and was first coined by Lutheran theologians Franz Buddeus and Jacob Carpov in the first half of the eighteenth century.

<a name="reformed" href="#contents" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:2.1em;">I. Reformed Theology</a>

Calvinism is a somewhat misleading label since it draws heavily from the writings of the early church father [St. Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) who lived during the 4th and 5th centuries, twelve hundred years prior to John Calvin (1509 – 1564) and the 16th century Protestant [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation). Theologians who followed the Augustinian tradition on this point included St. Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk. Everyone in this category can call themselves *Augustinian-Pauline Christians*.

> The man who most adamantly defended the Augustinian view of predestination was Martin Luther. ... Shortly after Luther's death, the Lutheran body, under the leadership of Philip Melancthon took a different turn and did not follow Martin Luther in his articulation of the view of predestination. But I think it's safe to say that Luther wrote more on predestination than Calvin ever dreamed of. &mdash; [R. C. Sproul (Ph.D., Whitefield Theological Seminary)](https://youtu.be/--fafICBts8?t=983)

✅ Reformed theology is securely [monergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/monergism/). Denominations associated with this theological tradition of Christianity are Presbyterianism, Reformed Churches, Reformed Baptists, some Anglican etc.

<!-- Dr. Packer is an evangelical theologian in the low-church Anglican and Calvinist traditions. -->

1. **Calling**
    - The general call to trust Christ is issued through the widespread offer of the Gospel. By means of this general call God sovereignly issues a special calling to the elect. The Spirit facilitates sinners’ response to the Gospel by enlightening their minds, liberating their wills, and inclining their affections Godward.
2. **Regeneration**
    - Without any human assistance the third person of the Trinity creates new spiritual life, including God-honoring dispositions, affections, and habits.
3. **Faith**
    - Having been granted new spiritual life, the elect believe the truths of the Gospel and trust Jesus Christ as Savior. Faith is viewed as a gift and enablement of God, indeed as a consequence of new spiritual birth.
4. **Repentance**
    - Here believers grieve for sins committed and deliberately turn from all known disobedience. This response likewise is a divine enablement.
5. **Justification**
    - On the basis of Christ’s completed work, the Father reckons to believers the righteousness of his Son, remits sins, and admits the same to the divine favor. Justification is the legal declaration of believing sinners’ right standing with God.
6. **Sanctification**
    - The Holy Spirit works in justified believers the will and the power progressively to renounce sin and to advance in spiritual maturity and Christlikeness. By the process of sanctification God makes believers experientially holy.
7. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - The God who has chosen, regenerated, justified, and sealed believers with his Spirit preserves them by his faithfulness and power to the very end. True believers persevere by virtue of the divine preservation.
8. **Glorification**
    - God will complete the redemption of the saints when the latter behold Christ at his second advent and are transformed into his likeness.

Ordo Salutis provided by Dr. Bruce Demarest's <a href="https://amzn.to/3HMIbPZ">"The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation (Foundations of Evangelical Theology)." pp. 36-44</a>

The order of salvation in Roman Catholic theology is usually expressed in terms of the grace mediated by the church’s sacraments.

1. **The sacrament of *baptism*** (Tit 3:5) 
    - imparts supernatural life by regenerating the soul and uniting it with Christ. Water baptism, in addition, is said to remove the guilt and penalty of original sin. Through the sacrament of baptism “Man is made white as a sheet, brighter than snow.”
2. **The sacrament of *confirmation*** (Acts 8:15-17)
    - strengthens the baptized through a Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Spirit. By this endowment the confirmed are enabled to witness to Christ and to stand firm in the midst of life’s struggles.
3. **The sacrament of the *Eucharist*** (Matt 26:26-28) 
    - imparts spiritual nourishment as the worshiper feeds on the body and blood of Christ in the transubstantiated wafer. “This sacrament is nourishment. It is for the divine life of the soul what food and drink are for the life of the body. This life, the state of grace, is maintained by it, preserved from ruin, strengthened and augmented.”13
4. **The sacrament of *penance*, or the “second pardon,”** 
    - remits the guilt and punishment of post-baptismal, mortal sins (apostasy, murder, adultery). The sacrament requires of the penitent contrition for sins, confession, and works of satisfaction (almsgiving, fasting, etc.).
5. **The sacrament of *extreme unction or last anointing*** (Jas 5:14-16)
    - equips the soul for the final conflict with death and prepares the recipient for the beatific vision of God. This sacrament “gives the grace of a good death, consolation in that depression which comes to so many because of the memory of their sins, and pardon for all sins not yet forgiven in confession.”

<a name="lutheran" href="#contents" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:2.1em;">III. Lutheran Theology</a>

Still debating if I should call this Melancthonism instead of Lutheranism, since Lutheranism [deviated from Luther, an Augustinian monk, who taught the Augustinian view of predestination](https://youtu.be/--fafICBts8?t=983). Mostly [Monergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/monergism/) from what I can tell, with hints of [sacerdotalism](https://carm.org/dictionary/sacerdotalism/) without being sacerdotalist.

1. **Calling or vocation**
    - God offers forgiveness of sins and right standing with himself through the offer of the Gospel that brings with it sufficient grace for the unconverted to respond to the message.
2. **Illumination**
    - The Gospel call universally imparts a certain illumination and quickening that enables the hearer to comprehend the benefits of accepting the Gospel and the consequences of rejecting it. 
3. **Conversion or repentance** 
    - This involves the work of the Spirit that leads sinners to remorse for their sins and to knowledge that they may be saved on the basis of Christ’s merits.
4. **Regeneration**
    - Repentance may result in the kindling of faith in the Gospel and then the transformation known as the new birth.
5. **Justification**
    - In response to a person’s faith God forgives sins, reck­ons the perfect righteousness of Christ, and bestows right standing with himself. 
6. **Mystical union**
    - By this step the believing soul is brought into a supernatural union of love with the triune God
7. **Renovation or sanctification**
    - Assisted by the Spirit, the justified advance in holiness and bring forth the supernatural fruits of the new life.
8. **Conservation**
    - Provided that the justified continue to heed biblical warnings about defection and persist in faith, God will preserve them safely to the end. The unbelieving, however, may fall away from grace and forfeit salvation. Christians must not presume on the Spirit’s grace.

<a name="arminian" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">IV. Arminian theology</a>

🚫 Arminians are thrice [synergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/synergism/). They view regeneration, sanctification, and perseverance as a synergistic activity. Worse still, they are [Semi-Pelagian](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/). Denominations associated with this theological tradition are Wesleyan and Methodist.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:1.6em;">Theologians w/ Systematic Theologies</span>


<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:1.6em;">Ordo Salutis</span>

Ordo Salutis provided by Dr. Bruce Demarest's <a href="https://amzn.to/3HMIbPZ">"The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation (Foundations of Evangelical Theology)." pp. 36-44</a>

1. **Universal, external calling**
    - God extends the call to salvation to all by a general work of the Spirit on the soul and by explicit Gospel proclamation. [Prevenient or “exciting” grace](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/), which allegedly proceeds universally from the Cross, alleviates the effects of depravity, thereby freeing all persons for moral and spiritual action.
        >⚠️ [Semi-Pelagianism](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/) is a modification of the Pelagianism heresy which was officially condemned by the church at the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431. Semi-Pelagianism was also condemned by the Council of Orange in 529 A.D. 

2. **Repentance and faith**
    - Since every person is transformed by prevenient grace, the human will is capable of freely turning from sin unto Christ. Given the fact that God commands sinners to work out their own salvation (Phil 2:12), conversion is a **synergistic activity**.
        >⚠️ Arminians view regeneration synergistically; the new birth occurs as a result of human willing and divine working. p. 35.

3. **Justification**
    - Since God does not declare anyone righteous in principle who is not so in practice, the forensic view of justification (the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to believing sinners) often is rejected. Arminians usually define justification as forgiveness of sins that in turn fosters the moral government of the universe.
4. **Sanctification**
    - Believers should seek that instantaneous, second blessing experience by which the Spirit eradicates sin and fills the heart with perfect love for God and others. This second work of grace is denoted “entire sanctification,” “Christian perfection,” and the “fullness of the blessing.” The term regeneration often is used inclusively to embrace the broad movement of salvation from conversion to sanctification.
        >⚠️ Furthermore, some affirm that God wills that sanctification be perfected in this life by a second work of grace that is said to eradicate the sinful nature and its desires, fill the heart with perfect love for God, and enable Christians to live without willful sin. This decisive post-conversion experience is designated “entire sanctification,” “sinless perfection,” and “full salvation.” p. 35.

5. **Perseverance**
    - Given their strong emphasis on free agency, many Arminians hold that believers by willful sin may fall completely from the state of grace. The possibility of final apostasy motivates Christians to holiness and constancy of life.
        >⚠️  In addition, many Arminians deny the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. They insist that by deliberate sin Christians can renounce their prior faith commitment and thereby fall from the state of grace, forfeit eternal salvation, and be doomed to perdition. The Arminian understanding of salvation thus is synergistic (a “working together”); divine grace and the liberated human will cooperate to bring about salvation. From inception to consummation the unsaved via free will make significant contributions to the outworking of their salvation. p. 35.

<a name="evangelical" href="#contents" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:2.1em;">V. Evangelicalism</a>

The truth is every tradition mentioned in this article, except Roman Catholicism, is evangelical. This section represents Evangelicals in the broadly reformed tradition, who don't fall into the other categories. **Theologians listed here may or may not agree with every point of the ordo salutis presented**, I'll eventually cover them individually.

> Evangelicals in the broadly Reformed tradition insist that the whole of salvation, from eternity past to eternity future, proceeds from the grace of
God, centers on Christ, and is wrought by the power of the Holy Spirit. &mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest

✅ [Monergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/monergism/). I identify as evangelical in addition to being reformed. I believe this to be a safe option like reformed theology as long as it remains true to historic protestantism in it's nuances and theological conservatism (no, not politics).

<!-- I grew up in Calvary Chapels when they were under the watchful eye of Chuck Smith. After his death, things got complicated and there have been very few who've taken up the mantle correctly. -->

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:1.6em;">Pastors & Preachers</span>

- Chuck Smith (BA, Life Bible College)
    - Election: *"**God clearly does choose**, but man must also accept God's invitation to salvation."* 
    - Perseverance: *"Apparently there are many who claim to be believers that in fact are not. ... **We do believe in perseverance of the saints (true believers)**, but are deeply concerned about sinful lifestyles and rebellious hearts among those who call themselves "Christians."*

1. **Election**
    - Without regard for foreseen human faith or good works, God in eternity past chose from among the lot of fallen humanity some to inherit eternal life.
2. **Effectual calling**
    - The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.
3. **Belief in the Gospel**
    - Quickened by the Spirit, the minds of the elect are persuaded of the truths of the Gospel of God’s grace.
4. **Repentance**
    - Likewise enabled by the Spirit the effectually called despise and turn away from all known sins.
5. **Trust in Christ**
    - The effectually called personally commit themselves to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their life.
6. **Regeneration**
    - God creates in justified believers new life, defined as the radical reorientation of the dispositions and affections toward God.
7. **Union with Christ**
    - The Spirit unites newly born saints with Jesus Christ in a vital, spiritual, and indissoluble union. The NT describes this experiential reality by the familiar “in Christ” motif.
8. **Justification**
    - God in turn reckons believing sinners righteous in his sight and bestows upon them the gift of eternal life.
9. **Sanctification**
    - By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.
10. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - By the application of divine power, God faithfully preserves regenerate saints in faith and hope unto the attainment of eternal life.
11. **Glorification**
    - God perfects the final and complete redemption of the believer—body, soul, and spirit—at the Parousia of the Lord Jesus Christ.

<a name="free" href="#contents" style="font-size:2em;">VI. "Free Grace" Theology</a>

Free Grace Theology is a minority view among the faculty members at Dallas Theological Seminary, more specifically this view comes from a man named Zane Hodges who taught from 1959 to 1986. Free grace theology was systematized by theologians such as Dr.’s Charles Ryrie and Zane Hodges in the 1980s as a response to "Lordship Salvation." Many of them claim their teachings come from Lewis Sperry Chafer who wrote his systematic theology in 1947-48 and his abridged work in 1988.

> The order is a logical one. Man needs to see his state of sin, have proof of the righteousness that the Savior provides, and be reminded that if he refuses to receive that Savior he faces certain condemnation.

[⚠️ Category mistakes in Greek surrounding the meaning of repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repent/). While it may be [monergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/monergism/) ask yourself the following question: does repentance mean *"feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense),"* or is it simply an intellectual assent to facts a *"change of mind"*?
- If you said *"change of mind,"* in the sense of an intellectual assent to facts, you have deviated from historical Christianity. This meaning finds no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon, any modern English translation, and it is without scholarly support from the academic community, or any standard Greek reference work. *"Real repentance is being so sorry, so contrite, that you do not do it again. You turn away from it and cease doing it."* &mdash; Chuck Smith

Correct definitions of [Repentance](https://bit.ly/3IchrbQ).

> Repentance is a **heartfelt sorrow** for sin, a renouncing of it, and a **sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ**. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (PhD, Cambridge; DD, Westminster)](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD).

It should be noted that one can apply the correct meaning of sorrow and contrition to *"change of mind"*. Instead of stopping at an intellectual assent to facts. These quotes are still applying the correct meaning. While Dr. Grudem is most correct, these are acceptable definitions.

> The New Testament word for repentance means changing one’s mind so
that one’s views, values, goals, and ways are changed and **one’s whole life is lived differently**. **The change is radical**, both inwardly and outwardly; mind and judgment, will and affections, behaviour and lifestyle, motives and purposes, are all involved. **Repenting means starting to live a new life.** &mdash; [J. I. Packer (Ph.D., Oxford)](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8). [Concise Theology](https://amzn.to/3JOaVKp).

> In Scripture, repentance means “to undergo a change of one’s mind.” This change of mind is **not a mere switching of minor opinions, but of the entire direction of one’s life**. It involves **a radical turning from sin** and to Christ. &mdash; [R. C. Sproul](https://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q) (Ph.D., Whitefield Theological Seminary). [Essential Truths](https://amzn.to/3FyUAqx).

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:1.6em;">Ordo Salutis</span>

The following description was supplied by Dr. Charles C. Ryrie in <span style="color:#A8A8A8;">Basic Theology: A Popular Systematic Guide To Understanding Biblical Truth. Section X. Chapter 56 The Application Of Salvation.</span>

1. **Conviction**
    - What? &mdash; The Lord promised that after Pentecost the Holy Spirit would convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8–11).
    - Who?  &mdash; It must mean a large number of people, more than the elect, but not everybody (cf. John 12:19).
    - How?  &mdash; We readily acknowledge that regeneration is the work of the Spirit... God must do even that.
2. **Calling**
    - General Call &mdash; God’s general invitation to men to come to Him.
    - **Effective Call** &mdash; This is the call that only the elect respond to through faith and that results in their salvation (Rom. 8:30; 1 Cor. 1:2). This is God’s work
3. **Regeneration**
    - Meaning &mdash; The word, used only twice in the New Testament (Matt. 19:28; Titus 3:5), means to be born again.
    - Means &mdash; God regenerates (John 1:13) according to His will (James 1:18) through the Holy Spirit (John 3:5) when a person believes (1:12) the Gospel as revealed in the Word (1 Pet. 1:23).
    - Relation &mdash; In the Reformed statement of the ordo salutis, regeneration precedes faith... this is admittedly stated only as a logical order... both regeneration and faith have to occur at the same moment. To be sure, faith is also part of the total package of salvation that is the gift of God (Eph. 2:9); yet faith is commanded in order to be saved (Acts 16:31). Both are true.
    - **Fruit** &mdash; The new life will bear new fruit. In 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, and 18, some of the results of the new life include righteousness, not committing sin, loving one another, and overcoming the world.
4. **Faith**
    - Meaning &mdash; Faith means confidence, trust, to hold something as true.
    - Necessity &mdash; Salvation is always through faith, not because of faith (Eph. 2:8). Faith is the channel through which we receive God’s gift of eternal life; it is not the cause...
    - Kinds &mdash; Intellectual / historical, miracle, temporary, saving.

<a name="lordship" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">VII. Lordship Salvation</a>

I have placed Lordship Salvation below Free Grace Theology because it may be a fabricated term, as historical protestant theologies have always stated that faith alone (*"sola fide"*) naturally results in obedience to God and good deeds after justification leading to a life devoid of hypocrisy and antinomianism; however, lordship salvation may be a concern and distinct from any other theology listed in this article, let's look at some concerns.

<!-- > I believe saving faith will **result** in obedience... We must guard jealously the fact that **faith alone is what saves us, not faith plus obedience**. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D., Westminster) Historical Protestant Position](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD) -->

<!-- <br>Augustinianism / Calvinism<br> -->

The reason I describe both lordship salvation and chaferanism ("free grace" theology) in grey zones is because they may allow for the possibility to fall into heresy and false assurance, not that they always do. Here are the questions that you should ask yourself to see if you're within the bounds of sound doctrine:

1. Does true saving faith ***include*** obedience or ***result*** in obedience?
    - If you said *"includes"* you're not historical in your Christianity as no historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. The safe answer is that it naturally *"results"* in obedience to God and good deeds after justification leading to a life devoid of hypocrisy and antinomianism.
2. Does scripture ***connect*** faith with obedience or does it ***equate*** faith with obedience?
    - If you said *"equate"* you've deviated from historical Christianity. The answer is that scripture *"connects"* faith with obedience.
3. Is repentance ***evidence*** of our salvation or is it ***proof*** of our salvation?
    - If you answered *"proof"* then your views are contrary to historical Christianity which states that it is *"evidence"* of our salvation, a way to have assurance.
4. Extra Credit: Does repentance mean *"feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense),"* or is it simply an intellectual assent to facts a *"change of mind"*?
    - If you said *"change of mind,"* in the sense of an intellectual assent to facts, you have deviated from historical Christianity. This meaning finds no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon, any modern English translation, and it is without scholarly support from the academic community, or any standard Greek reference work. *"Real repentance is being so sorry, so contrite, that you do not do it again. You turn away from it and cease doing it."* &mdash; Chuck Smith

<a name="amyraldism" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">VIII. Amyraldism</a>

Amyraldism, also known as Amyraldianism, is an attempt to reconcile the doctrines of predestination and election with the belief in a libertarian version of free will instead of the freedom of inclination of the Calvinists. This view is also known as moderate calvinism, and "four-point" calvinism.

> The basic difference may be said to boil down to the question: Who determines who are to be saved? According to Semi-Pelagians, Arminians and Wesleyans, man determines. All hinges on human choice. In a strange way, so agrees **Norman Geisler**, who in an effort to avoid what he calls extreme Calvinism manages to become not a **moderate Calvinist** but a pretty good [**synergist**](https://carm.org/dictionary/synergism/), i.e. an Arminian. &mdash; Robert Duncan Culver (Professor of Theology at Wheaton College and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School).

> **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.**
Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‘faith apart from observing the law’, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But **if ‘good works’ (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith**, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, **justifying faith (fiducia) is not yet ours**. &mdash; [Concise Theology.

<!-- > When we talk about the order of salvation, we talk about the ordo salutis, we are talking not so much about the temporal order of things but rather a logical order of things. The difference between temporal priority and logical priority is this, when we say that justification is by faith alone we do not mean by that that a person has faith and then five years later is justified. No, the second that you have faith you are counted righteous by God and are covered with the robes of the righteousness of Christ and have all the benefits of justification. There is no time lapse in there, but yet we say that justification is by faith, meaning that faith comes logically before justification or we would say “faith is by  justification alone.” We know that justification does not precede faith, but faith precedes justification in terms of its logical order. -->

- Protestants compose the largest percent of the <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/science/">greatest minds</a> ever to have existed in the sciences, especially for the last hundred years of nobel prize.
- The Reformed traditions consistantly produce some of the finest minds theology has ever produced throughout history all the way down to modern times. They single handedly are responsible for some of the most accurate Bible versions on earth.

<!-- - The <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/24-reasons-esv-net-nlt/" style="color:#A8A8A8">most accurate</a> Bibles mankind has ever produced come from those who have concluded a reformed theology. Metzger's NOAB being the most ecumenical.

**For reasons like these, I do advocate for a return to the purity of historical protestant theologies.** The Bible does warn us of a coming apostasy, a great falling away from the faith. We see this in the cults which began springing up very late in church history, especially the 19th century and later. I do believe the reformers, who gave us the five solas, are in fact the safest and most historically consistent choice, and so I currently identify with reformed theology.
