Salvation is by grace alone and justification in the sight of God is by faith alone. 

> For we hold that one is justified by **faith apart from works** of the law. &mdash; Romans 3:28 ESV (cf. Eph 2:8-10)

Faith is the instrument by which we lay hold of God's grace, faith means to "trust in" God, it is a reliance on him for salvation apart from any works we can do. We cannot merit our salvation.

> Remain in me, and I will remain in you. **Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself**, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me. &mdash; John 15:4

Once a person is saved and justified by this trust/faith, he will receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit the moment we believe (Eph 1:13-14), and we learn in both Galatians 5:22-23 and John 15:1-17 that God works these fruits of the faith in us, like obedience (1Jn 2:4), repentance (Lk 13:3) and good works (James 2:14-26) that characterize a Holy Spirit filled individual.

> ‚ÄúYes, I am the vine; you are the branches. **Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit.** For apart from me you can do nothing. &mdash; John 15:5

We're not saved by these fruits, salvation simply produces them post-justification "after we're already saved." That is why I say, obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience.

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me.** And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.‚Äù &mdash; John 14:21 (cf. Jn 14:15)

<!-- And that is what I and other basic protestants like Chuck Smith, Ron Rhodes, Chuck Missler, and Geisler, Packer, Ryrie, and Grudem all teach. -->

Being a basic or historic protestant makes us a part of the group responsible for the original reformation doctrine of faith alone or sole fide. A faith that results in dispositions of love and Godly character.

> Some people may contradict our teaching, but **these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. These teachings promote a godly life.** 4 Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding... &mdash; 1 Timothy 6:3-4 NLT

By grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to scripture alone, for the glory of God alone. These are known as the [Five Solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg).

God bless.
