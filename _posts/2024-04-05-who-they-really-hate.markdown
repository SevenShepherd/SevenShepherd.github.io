<!-- In a sea of truth-seekers, there are some among you who masquerade as the flock, but hate the teachings of repentance (Ac 17:30) and fruit-bearing (Jn 15:5). They live unrighteously, and despise other believers (1Jn 3:10 NLT) who teach it. I feel your burning hatred and hostility for the truth (1Jn 3:15). Listen closely, it is not me that you hate, it is Christ (Jn 7:7 NLT), for he is the one who taught these things (Mk 1:14-15). -->

> The world can‚Äôt hate you, but it does hate me because I accuse it of doing evil. &mdash; **Jesus** in John 7:7 NLT

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, is not true faith. It is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26).

> &ldquo;If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, you are not worthy of being mine.&rdquo; &mdash; **Jesus** in Matthew 10:38 NLT

The change of life that will &ldquo;*result*&rdquo; from genuine conversion *does not save us*, but it will certainly result if our faith is genuine, for *"faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead" (James 2:17)*.

> ‚ÄúNo, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.‚Äù ‚Äî **Jesus** in Luke 13:3

<!-- If you have fallen away, I would ask you to repent like Christ commanded you to (Mt 4:17; Ac 17:30). Turn away from your apostasy (Ac 3:19; Ac 26:20), put your faith in the person of Christ (Mark 1:15). Genuine saving faith will &ldquo;*result*&rdquo; in fruit (John 15:1-17; Gal 5:22-23) progressively, this is how we know we are living in Him (1Jn 2:3-6). -->

If you are unrepentant (Lk 13:3) and you pursue lifestyles of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Gal 5:19-21) the only assurance you have, is no assurance. This is your wake up call (Re 3:3). You should be told to test to see if your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), to see if you really are trusting in Christ, because if you were, you'd be repentant, you'd carry your cross daily (Mt 10:38; Lk 9:23), you'd be bearing the fruits of obedience (John 15:1-17; James 2:14-26; Jn 14:15; 1 Jn 2:4), and you'd have the assurance of being foreknown (Mt 22:14). These are divine enablements.

> And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. **If someone claims, ‚ÄúI know God,‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt obey God‚Äôs commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth.** But those who obey God‚Äôs word truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in him. Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did. &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 NLT ([article](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/))

It is a simple thing to prove that repentance is both [an inward resolve to turn from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/), and that it necessarily follows genuine saving faith. The scripture below proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that a true born again has undergone regeneration by the power of the Holy Spirit. They no longer &ldquo;*practice*&rdquo; and pursue lifestyles of sin.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Little children, let no one deceive you.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil</span>, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">No one born of God makes a practice of sinning</span>, for God's seed abides in him; and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">he cannot keep on sinning</span>, because he has been born of God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">By this it is evident</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">who are the children of God</span>, and <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:Red;">who are the children of the devil</span>: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. &mdash; 1 John 3:6-10 ESV

It would be legalistic to say, repent to merit or earn justification; however, it is not legalistic to point out that repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. 1 John 3:6-10 single handedly dismantles every antinomian heretic theology in existence. The raw logical conclusion is thus:

### Repentance

- Taught alongside faith by Christ Himself (Mark 1:14-15).
- One of the reasons Jesus came (Lk 5:32).
- Taught as [**an inward resolve to turn from sin**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
- **An immediate fruit** of genuine saving faith resulting in good works and righteous behavior (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5).
- **Will happen** in genuine believers (1Jn 3:6-10). logically (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
- **Commanded** by God (Ac 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- **Granted** by God (Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25).
- Growth **given** by God (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4).
- Preached **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Produced from Godly sorrow (2 Cor. 7:10; Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- **Leading to salvation** and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Described as **needed** and necessary (Lk 15:7).
- Repent or Perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Unrepentant sin not tolerated and not a one time event (Lk 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:11-13).
- Imperfect (1Jn 1:8‚Äì10; 2:1-2).
- Not justifying (Rom 3:28; Eph 2:8-10).

I would conclude that an unrepentant person is an unregenerate person.

<!-- ### Logic


1. God commands that you repent (Ac 17:30) and those who say they "know God" but do not obey His commandments are liars and not living in the truth (1Jn 2:4). They have given strong evidence of false profession (2 Peter 2:21-22).
2. Those who do not repent will die (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3).
3. Those who do not obey God's commandments do not love God (Jn 14:15,21) and God gave us the commandment to repent (Ac 17:30), so those who do not repent do not love God.
4. Those who do not repent do not want their sins forgiven (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 5:31; 17:30; 2Cor 7:10).
5. Those who do not repent do not want to be led to salvation (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18).
6. The consequences of failing to repent are disasterous (Re 2:5,16; 3:3; 16:9)


1. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** that they do not love God (Ac 17:30; Jn 14:15,21)
4. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of not being led to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18)
5. Faith that does not &ldquo;result&rdquo; in repentance is not a faith (Jas 2:19) that leads to salvation (2Cor. 7:10). It is a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#living">dead faith</a>. -->
