In a sea of truth-seekers, there are some among you who masquerade as the flock, but hate the teachings of repentance (Ac 17:30) and fruit-bearing (Jn 15:5). I feel your burning hatred and hostility for the truth (1Jn 3:15). Listen closely, it is not me that you hate, it is Christ, for he is the one who taught these things (Jn 7:7). Repent.

> The world can’t hate you, but it does hate me because I accuse it of doing evil. &mdash; John 7:7 NLT

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, is not true faith. It is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26).

> If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, you are not worthy of being mine. &mdash; Matthew 10:38 NLT

The change of life that will &ldquo;*result*&rdquo; from genuine conversion **does not save us**, but it will certainly result if our faith is genuine, for *"faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead" (James 2:17)*.
