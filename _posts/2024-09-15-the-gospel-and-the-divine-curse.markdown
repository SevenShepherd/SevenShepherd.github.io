This is a warning to all "teachers" who have fallen away from the truth; to repent away from falsehood and teach the gospel correctly.

> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! <sup style="font-size:bold;">9</sup> As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse! &mdash; Galatians 1:8-9 NIV

There are some out there who do not preach the full council of God because they misinterpret scripture. Woe to them. They may be attacking Christ himself.

> Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">proclaiming the gospel of God</span>, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkRed;">repent</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">and</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkRed;">believe</span> in the gospel.” &mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Jesus</span> in Mark 1:14-15 ESV preaching and proclaiming that repentance is part of the gospel.

Jesus taught that repentance is [a turning from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repent-means-turn/) to God (Acts 3:26,19), the Apostle Paul revealed that repentance is produced from godly sorrow (2Cor 7:10), and Jude reveals that we should hate sin but remain merciful to the sinner (Jude 23).

> When God raised up his servant, Jesus, he sent him <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">first</span> to you people of Israel, to bless you by <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">turning each of you back from your sinful ways</span>. &mdash; Acts 3:26 NLT

>> <span style="font-size:0.8em;">26: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">First to you, Jews will be followed by Gentiles</span> in God’s plan for salvation. Wicked ways, from which Jews <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Goldenrod;">must repent</span> (v. 19) &mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Purple;">The <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:DarkOrchid;">Jewish</span> Annotated New Testament (TJANT)</span></span>

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.

> The term [metanoéō (μετανοέω)](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) means *“feel remorse, repent, be converted in a (religio-)ethical sense,”* while [metánoia (μετάνοια)](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) means *“repentance, turning about, conversion”* (Bauer et al. 567–568). These definitions are drawn from [the world's most authoritative Greek lexicon available](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/#BDAG).
