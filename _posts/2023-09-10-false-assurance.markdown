<!-- A Good Leader For Christ Does Not Compromise On The Truth, A Bad Leader Sugar Coats The Truth, Thereby Perverting It's Message And Giving False Assurance -->

False assurance speaks of &ldquo;those who are not saved, but have the assurance that they are saved.&rdquo;

> ‚ÄúWhy do you call me ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô and not do what I tell you? &mdash; Luke 6:46

Jesus warning on the sermon on the mount taught that many would come to him in the last days saying &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; obviously these people come to Jesus fully assured that they belong to him, and he rejects them, thereby exposing their assurance as counterfeit.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">On that day many will say to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,</span> did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?‚Äô <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">And then will I declare to them, ‚ÄòI never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.‚Äô</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:21-23

## I. Universalism

# The Doctrine Of Justification By Death
<!-- # The False Assurance Of Universalism -->

The false teaching of universalism says that everybody dies and goes to Heaven. This is probably the biggest form of false assurance that exists. 

> And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment &mdash; Hebrews 9:27

Universalism gives false assurance because it explicitly goes against scripture.

> I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak &mdash; Matthew 12:36

Jesus taught more about Hell than he did about Heaven.

<!-- "Faith alone" is a reformation doctrine. -->

## II. Legalism

# Works Righteousness

This false teaching leads to false assurance because it teaches that all you have to do to get into heaven is obey the law of God and live a good life, that your good works and your good deeds will get you into Heaven. People think that there is some kind of standard that they have met, and on the basis of their self-evaluation of their character, and of their performance, they have confidence that they will pass the exam and meet the requirements to enter Heaven.

> Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague &mdash; [**Dr. J. I. Packer**](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8) (Ph.D., University of Oxford) [Concise Theology. Chapter 65 Legalism. p. 191.](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A)

When God asks these people why he should let them into his Heaven, they would likely respond "well I lived a good life," "I'm a good person," or maybe even <span style="color:#828282">&ldquo;did we not... do many mighty works in your name?&rdquo; (Mt 7:22)</span> etc. 

> "For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin" (Ro 3:20).

The scriptures are clear however that we are not saved by works (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28). If anyone embodies this false understanding of salvation, it would be the rich young ruler who encountered Jesus during Jesus' earthly ministry (only God is good. Mt 19:16-17 ESV; Jn 10:11,14; Ps 23:1 LEB).

> as it is written: ‚ÄúNone is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.‚Äù &mdash; Romans 3:10-12 (cf. Ps 14:1-3; 53:1-3)

We know that Justification is by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-10), so it cannot be because you were a good person or your many good works.

## III. Sacerdotalism 

# Salvation Accomplished Through The Priesthood

Those lost in this false form of assurance might say to God on judgement day "I was baptized," "I had the sacrament of penance," "I had the lords supper," "I'm a Methodist," etc. This is the same error that the Pharisees committed because they were circumcised. The sacraments are very important but **no sacrament has ever saved anybody**, and if you put your trust in the sacraments then you have a false assurance of salvation, because your trusting in something to save you that neither does save you or can save you.

## IV. False Assurances Within Evangelicalism

# Pray The Sinners Pray, Raise Your Hands, Go Forward At An Alter Call, Make A Decision

In the Evangelical world there are similar false assurances to those mentioned above. Please guys, don't think you're saved because you did something and because you trust "in that" rather than "in Christ." If your faith is in these actions rather than in Christ, you too have false assurance. Trust Christ only for salvation. The things mentioned in the subheading aren't necessarily bad things, but they should never be things you trust in for salvation. Christ alone!

<!-- ## V. Antinomianism & Dead Faith -->

## V. Antinomianism

# Saving Faith Vs Dead Faith

There are two verses in the Bible that talk about the difference between a dead faith and a living faith. The first such instance is in James 2:14-26 where James implies that a *dead faith* is not the kind of faith that saves. 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if **someone** says he has faith but does not have works? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Can that faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">save him</span>?</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and filled,‚Äù without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> So also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">faith by itself, if it does not have works, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:14-17 ESV

James goes on to say that *intellectual assent to facts* is a type of belief that even a demon can exercise. We can conclude that if it's not a dead faith that saves, then the faith that justifies is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive, and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.

> Even the demons know who God is and know the facts about Jesus‚Äô life and saving works, for James says, ‚ÄúYou believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe‚Äîand shudder!‚Äù (James 2:19). But that knowledge certainly does not mean that the demons are saved. ‚Äî Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge), Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. pp. 861-862.

We can also draw this same conclusion from second corinthians. We can see that the Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

> Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?‚Äîunless indeed you fail to meet the test! &mdash; 2 Corinthians 13:5

The reason I have spent the time explaining the difference between a dead faith and a living faith is to describe how people fall into the heresy of antinomianism. It would seem there is a growing concern over this form of false assurance; there are actually teachers out there who violate the message of the Apostles (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62), falsely teaching that God's grace allows us to live immoral lives, which the Bible does not support in any way, shape, or form.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">ungodly men</span> who have turned the grace of our God into a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">license for evil</span></span> and who <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">deny our only <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Master and Lord</span>, Jesus Christ</span>. &mdash; Jude 1:4 NET

It's true that we are saved by grace and faith alone (Eph 2:8-10), but it's also true that saving faith results in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that follow after justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">If someone claims, ‚ÄúI know God,‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt obey God‚Äôs commandments, <span style="color:orangered;">that person is a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">liar</span> and is not living in the truth</span>.</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> But those who **obey** God‚Äôs word truly show how completely they love him. **That is how we know** we are living in him. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.</span> &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 [NLT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A36%3B+1Jn+2%3A3-6&version=ESV;NET;NLT)

## Conclusion

Saving faith is composed of three essential elements: notitia, assensus, and fiducia. As Packer points out in Concise Theology: "Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14)." The latin term notitia means 'knowledge' and refers to an "acquaintance with the content of the gospel"; assensus or ‚Äòagreement‚Äô means "recognition that the gospel is true"; fiducia means ‚Äòtrust and reliance‚Äô and it speaks of the "personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one‚Äôs own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3)."

> Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism. Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‚Äòfaith apart from observing the law‚Äô, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But if ‚Äògood works‚Äô (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, justifying faith (fiducia) is not yet ours. ‚Äî Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford), Concise Theology. pp. 173-175.

Justification is by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified.

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD)

Here is a list of verses that give assurance without giving you false assurance. While works definitely do not save us, they do spring forth from a true and lively faith.

- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
- Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
- The practice of unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (1 Cor. 5:12-13; Luke 17:3-4)
- Those who practice lifelong habitual sin are self-deceived (James 1:22) and will not inherit the kingdom of God (Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:3-5)
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (Mt 10:38; 16:24; Lk 9:23,62; 14:27; Mk 8:34... Mt 3:10; 25:30; Jn 15:8 ESV)
- True Christians love God by obeying him (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4).
- True Christians love other believers (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
- The Bible teaches us to live Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12).
- The teaching of obedience to God after justification is not burdensome, in fact it's a reason for joy (1 Jn 5:3-4; Jn 15:10-11).

> Such as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavoring to walk in all good conscience before him, may, in this life, be **certainly** assured that **they are in the state of grace**... This **certainty** is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion... but an **infallible** assurance of faith founded upon the divine truth of the promises of salvation, the inward evidences of those graces unto which these promises are made, the testimony of the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God. &mdash; Westminister Confession of Faith (1643-1646) (18.1-2)
