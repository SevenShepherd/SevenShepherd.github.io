<!-- The Paradoxical Irony of Accusing Others of Judgmentalism Without Ever Being Personally Attacked -->

![John the Baptist preaching repentance and being called judgemental meme](/assets/images/repent-meme.jpg)

If you accuse someone of being judgemental and they have never personally attacked you, then you have become the very thing that you hate. [Here is some educational material.](https://youtube.com/shorts/DtVwpbNWwIo?feature=share) 

<!-- That concludes this ministries shortest article. -->

# Repentance
- Repentance is **a turning away from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is **a Godly sorrow** that **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance is necessary (Lk 13:3) **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5)

<!-- - As [every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/), **the meaning does not reflect it's etymology**: all instances of the Greek words for repentance fall under the second meaning of “feel remorse, repent, be converted” (in religio-ethical sense). -->

> The gospel can be summarized in different ways. Sometimes faith alone is named as the one thing necessary for salvation (see John 3:16; Acts 16:31; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 2:8–9), other times repentance alone is named (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10), and sometimes both are named (Acts 20:21). **Genuine faith always involves repentance, and vice versa**.

<!-- - A person is not judgemental for believing things that offend you.
    - You are if you hate them for it.
- A person is not judgemental for teaching the truth even if you don't like it.
    - You are if you hate them for it.
- A person is not judgemental for disagreeing with you.
    - You are if you hate them for it.

I am shocked that I have to write an elementary article like this. When you hate people who have never personally attacked you and then you escalate it further by slandering them or otherwise, you're acting on behalf of Satan. -->
