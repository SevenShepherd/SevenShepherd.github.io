If you accuse someone of being judgemental and they have never personally attacked you, then you have become the very thing that you hate. [Here is some educational material.](https://youtube.com/shorts/DtVwpbNWwIo?feature=share) That concludes this ministries shortest article.

<!-- - A person is not judgemental for believing things that offend you.
    - You are if you hate them for it.
- A person is not judgemental for teaching the truth even if you don't like it.
    - You are if you hate them for it.
- A person is not judgemental for disagreeing with you.
    - You are if you hate them for it.

I am shocked that I have to write an elementary article like this. When you hate people who have never personally attacked you and then you escalate it further by slandering them or otherwise, you're acting on behalf of Satan. -->
