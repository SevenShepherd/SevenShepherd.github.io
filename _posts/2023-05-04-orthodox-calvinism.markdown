<span style="font-size:2.1em">What Orthodox Calvinism Says</span>

> The dreadful error of hyper-Calvinism is that it involves God in coercing sin. This does radical violence to the integrity of God’s character. &mdash; [Dr. R. C. Sproul (Ph.D., Whitefield)](https://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q), 5-Point Orthodox Calvinist "Strong Calvinist"

|Calvinism|Hyper-Calvinism|

|positive-negative|positive-positive|
|asymmetrical view|symmetrical view|
|unequal ultimacy|equal ultimacy|
|God passes over the reprobate|God works unbelief in the hearts of the reprobate.|

<span style="font-size:2.1em">What Moderate Calvinism Says</span>

Norman Geisler is a well known Moderate Calvinist, so we'll let him defend the position.

> ... Supralapsarians are hyper-Calvinists, being double-predestinarians. 10 Infralapsarians are strong Calvinists but are not double-predestinarians. Sublapsarians (Amyraldians) are moderate Calvinists, holding to unlimited atonement. &mdash; Norman Geisler, Systematic Theology Vol. 3 Sin & Salvation. Ch. 7.

|Strong Calvinists|Hyper-Calvinists|
|:-:|:-:|
|Only elect are actively predestined|Elect and non-elect are actively predestined|
|God is passive in not choosing the nonelect|God is active in choosing both|
|Faith given to the elect|Unbelief given to the nonelect|
|Asymmetrical relation|Symmetrical relation|
|Predestination is positive of the elect and negative of the non-elect|Predestination is positive of both|
|Unequal ultimacy|Equal ultimacy|

<sup>"This chart is similar to one by R. C. Sproul in Chosen by God, 143." &mdash; Geisler</sup>

> There is, however, a significant difference between the hyper-Calvinists and other Calvinists regarding election. It can be summarized as follows: &mdash; Norman Geisler

|Other Calvinists|Hyper-Calvinists|
|:-:|:-:|
|God elects only believers|God also elects unbelievers|
|God elects only to heaven|God also elects to hell|
|God’s election of unbelievers to
hell is passive|God’s election of unbelievers to
hell is active|
