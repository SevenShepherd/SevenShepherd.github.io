<span style="font-size:2.1em">What Orthodox Calvinism Says</span>

> The dreadful error of hyper-Calvinism is that it involves God in coercing sin. This does radical violence to the integrity of God’s character. &mdash; [Dr. R. C. Sproul (Ph.D., Whitefield)](https://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q), 5-Point Orthodox Calvinist

<span style="font-size:2.1em">What Moderate Calvinism Says</span>

Norman Geisler (M.A., Theology at Wheaton) was a well known Moderate Calvinist. Geisler has been known to employ strawman arguments against orthodox Calvinists. ⚠️ Warning: Geisler argues for against monergism. Christianity is monergistic, the cults are synergistic.

> "an inconsistent and therefore unstable form of Calvinism" &mdash; B. B. Warfield (Professor of Theology at Princeton) (1915), The Plan of Salvation, Philadelphia: Presbyterian Board of Publication, pp. 119–120

> The basic difference may be said to boil down to the question: Who determines who are to be saved? According to Semi-Pelagians, Arminians and Wesleyans, man determines. All hinges on human choice. In a strange way, so agrees **Norman Geisler**, who in an effort to avoid what he calls extreme Calvinism manages to become not a **moderate Calvinist** but a pretty good [**synergist**](https://carm.org/dictionary/synergism/), i.e. an Arminian. &mdash; Robert Duncan Culver (Professor of Theology at Wheaton College and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School). Systematic Theology, Biblical and Historical. Part 3. 8 Theories of the Imputation of Sin.

Here are a few of Geisler's quotes.

<!-- but these quotes seem good. However, Ron Rhodes seems to be a more doctrinally sound 4-point calvinist than geisler. Norman argues for synergism which is what the cults are into so be warned. -->

<!-- > ... biblical, theological, and historical evidence favors the **moderate Calvinist** view. &mdash; Norman Geisler, Systematic Theology Vol. 3 Sin & Salvation. Ch. 5. -->

> ... <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">Supralapsarians are hyper-Calvinists, being double-predestinarians.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">Infralapsarians are strong Calvinists but are not double-predestinarians.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#FBB917;">Sublapsarians (Amyraldians) are moderate Calvinists, holding to unlimited atonement.</span> &mdash; Norman Geisler, Systematic Theology Vol. 3 Sin & Salvation. Ch. 7.

He should have said that this confirms all historic protestant views, including every flavor of calvinism, lutheranism, etc.

> 1 John 3:9 John affirmed that “no one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.” **This confirms moderate Calvinism**’s view of eternal security for two reasons. First, anyone truly born of God cannot persist in evil. **If someone does, then he is not born of God.** That is, a Christian’s perseverance in avoiding continual, habitual sin is a proof of his salvation &mdash; Norman Geisler, Systematic Theology Vol. 3 Sin & Salvation. Ch. 11.

Some good quotes on saving faith.

> As Ryrie put it, "**Saving faith is a working faith**, and those works justify believers in the courtroom on earth," and **an "unproductive faith is a spurious faith."** &mdash; Norman Geisler, Four Views On Eternal Security. p. 107. <sup style="color:#A8A8A8;"><sup>45</sup>Ryrie, So GreatSalvation, 110-11.</sup>

> As Charles Ryrie correctly observed, "every Christian will bear fruit; **otherwise he or she is not a true believer**." For 'fruit, then, furnishes evidence of saving faith. The evidence may be strong or weak, erratic or regular, visible or not. But a **saving faith works**," &mdash; Norman Geisler, Four Views On Eternal Security. p. 105.
