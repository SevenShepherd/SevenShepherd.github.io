<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">Although</span> the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men unexcusable;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> yet are they not sufficient to
give that knowledge of God, and of His will, which is necessary unto
salvation.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in
divers manners, to reveal Himself, and to declare that His will unto
His Church;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and afterwards for the better preserving and
propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and
comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the
malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto
writing;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> which makes the Holy Scripture to be most necessary;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>
those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people being
now ceased.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

are now contained all the books of the Old and New Testament,
which are these:

<ol start="7">
  <li id="7">Luk 16:29,31; Eph 2:20; Rev 22:18,19; 2Ti 3:16</li>
</ol>

<!-- 7. Luk 16:29; Eph 2:20; Rev 22:18; 2Ti 3:16 -->

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine
inspiration, are no part of the canon of the Scripture, and therefore
are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise
approved, or made use of, than other human writings.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup>

<ol start="8">
    <li id="8">Luk 24:27,44; Rom 3:2; 2Pe 1:21</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be
believed, and obeyed, depends not upon the testimony of any man,
or Church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author
thereof: and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of
God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup>

<ol start="9">
    <li id="9">2Pe 1:19,21; 2Ti 3:16; 1Jo 5:9; 1Th 2:13</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to
an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scripture.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> And the
heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty
of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole
(which is, to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the
only way of man's salvation, the many other incomparable
excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments
whereby it does abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God:
yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the
infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of
the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup>

<ol start="10">
    <li id="10">1Ti 3:15</li>
    <li id="11">1Jo 2:20,27; Joh 16:13,14; 1Co 2:10,11,12; Isa 59:21</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VI.</span> The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for His
own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down
in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be
deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be
added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the
Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such
things as are revealed in the Word:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> and that there are some
circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of
the Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be
ordered by the light of nature, and Christian prudence, according to
the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup>
 
<ol start="12">
    <li id="12">2Ti 3:15,16,17; Gal 1:8,9; 2Th 2:2</li>
    <li id="13">Joh 6:45; 1Co 2:9-12</li>
    <li id="14">1Co 11:13,14; 1Co 14:26,40</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VII.</span> All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike
clear unto all:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> yet those things which are necessary to be known,
believed, and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded, and
opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the
learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may
attain unto a sufficient understanding of them.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup>

<ol start="15">
    <li id="15">2Pe 3:16</li>
    <li id="16">Psa 119:105,130</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VIII.</span> The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language
of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek
(which, at the time of the writing of it, was most generally known to
the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and, by His singular
care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> so as, in all controversies of religion, the Church is finally to
appeal unto them.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> But, because these original tongues are not
known to all the people of God, who have right unto, and interest in
the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and
search them,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup>
therefore they are to be translated in to the vulgar
language of every nation unto which they come,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup>
that, the Word of
God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable
manner;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may
have hope.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup>

<ol start="17">
    <li id="17">Mat 5:18</li>
    <li id="18">Isa 8:20; Act 15:15; Joh 5:39,46</li>
    <li id="19">Joh 5:39</li>
    <li id="20">1Co 14:6,9,11,12,24,27,28</li>
    <li id="21">Col 3:16</li>
    <li id="22">Rom 15:4</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IX.</span> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture
itself: and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full
sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be
searched and known by other places that speak more clearly.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup>

<ol start="23">
    <li id="23">2Pe 1:20,21; Act 15:15,16</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">X.</span> The supreme judge by which all controversies of religion are to be
determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers,
doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in
whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit
speaking in the Scripture.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of God's Eternal Decree</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">God</span> from all eternity, did, by the most wise and holy counsel of His
own will, freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to
pass;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> nor is
violence offered to the will of the creatures; nor is the liberty or

sometimes also withdraws the gifts which they had,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> and exposes
them to such objects as their corruption makes occasion of sin;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">The</span> distance between God and the creature is so great, that
although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto Him as their
Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of Him as their
blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on
God's part, which He has been pleased to express by way of
covenant.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that

called the covenant of grace; wherein He freely offers unto sinners
life and salvation by Jesus Christ; requiring of them faith in Him, that
they may be saved,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> and promising to give unto all those that are
ordained unto eternal life His Holy Spirit, to make them willing, and

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in scripture by the

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> This covenant was differently administered in the time of the law,
and in the time of the Gospel:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> under the law it was administered by
promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb,
and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews,
all foresignifying Christ to come;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> which were, for that time,
sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit, to
instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> by
whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal salvation; and is
called the Old Testament.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VI.</span> Under the Gospel, when Christ, the substance,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> was exhibited,
the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching
of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments of Baptism
and the Lord's Supper:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> which, though fewer in number, and
administered with more simplicity, and less outward glory, yet, in
them, it is held forth in more fullness, evidence, and spiritual efficacy,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup>
to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and is called the New

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Mat 17:12; Jam 1:14; Deut 30:19</li>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom, and power to will

himself thereunto.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup>

evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by
imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Sanctification</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">They</span>, who are once effectually called, and regenerated, having a
new heart, and a new spirit created in them, are further sanctified,
really and personally, through the virtue of Christ's death and
resurrection,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> by His Word and Spirit dwelling in them:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>
the
dominion of the whole body of sin is destroyed,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and the several
lusts thereof are more and more weakened and mortified;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> and they
more and more quickened and strengthened in all saving graces,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>
to the practice of true holiness, without which no man shall see the
Lord.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<ol start="1">

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> This sanctification is throughout, in the whole man;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> yet imperfect
in this life, there abiding still some remnants of corruption in every
part;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> whence arises a continual and irreconcilable war, the flesh

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> In which war, although the remaining corruption, for a time, may
much prevail;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> yet, through the continual supply of strength from
the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the regenerate part does overcome;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> and so, the saints grow in grace,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> perfecting holiness in the

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Saving Faith</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">The</span> grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the
saving of their souls,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>
is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their
hearts,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the Word,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> by
which also, and by the administration of the sacraments, and prayer,
it is increased and strengthened.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Heb 10:39</li> 
    <li id="2">2Co 4:13; Eph 1:17,18,19; Eph 2:8</li>

    <li id="4">1Pe 2:2; Act 20:32; Rom 4:11; Luk 17:5; Rom 1:16,17</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> By this faith, a Christian believes to be true whatsoever is
revealed in the Word, for the authority of God Himself speaking
therein;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> and acts differently upon that which each particular
passage thereof contains; yielding obedience to the commands,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>
trembling at the threatenings,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> and embracing the promises of God
for this life, and that which is to come.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> But the principal acts of
saving faith are accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone
for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the
covenant of grace.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup>

<ol start="5">
    <li id="5">Joh 4:42; 1Th 2:13; 1Jo 5:10; Act 24:14</li>

    <li id="9">Joh 1:12; Act 16:31; Gal 2:20; Act 15:11</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> This faith is different in degrees, weak or strong;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> may often
and many ways assailed, and weakened, but gets the victory:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup>
growing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance, through
Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> who is both the author and finisher of our faith.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Repentance unto Life</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">Repentance</span> unto life is an evangelical grace,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>
the doctrine
whereof is to be preached by every minister of the Gospel, as well
as that of faith in Christ.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Zec 12:10; Act 11:18</li> 
    <li id="2">Luk 24:47; Mar 1:15; Act 20:21</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> By it, a sinner, out of the sight and sense not only of the danger,
but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to
the holy nature, and righteous law of God; and upon the
apprehension of His mercy in Christ to such as are penitent, so
grieves for, and hates his sins, as to turn from them all unto God,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>
purposing and endeavouring to walk with Him in all the ways of His
commandments.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

<ol start="3">
    <li id="3">Eze 18:30,31; Ezek 36:31; Isa 30:22; Psa 51:4; Jer 31:18,19; Joe 2:12,13; Amos 5:15; Psa 119:128; 2Co 7:11</li> 
    <li id="4">Psa 119:6,59,106; Luk 1:6; 2Ki 23:25</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> Although repentance is not to be rested in, as any satisfaction for
sin, or any cause of the pardon thereof,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> which is the act of God's
free grace in Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> yet it is of such necessity to all sinners, that
none may expect pardon without it.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup>

<ol start="5">
    <li id="5">Eze 36:31,32; Eze 16:61-63</li> 
    <li id="6">Hos 14:2,4; Rom 3:24; Eph 1:7</li> 
    <li id="7">Luk 13:3; Act 17:30,31</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> As there is no sin so small, but it deserves damnation;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> so there
is no sin so great, that it can bring damnation upon those who truly
repent.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup>

<ol start="8">
    <li id="8">Rom 6:23; Rom 5:12; Mat 12:36</li> 
    <li id="9">Isa 55:7; Rom 8:1; Isa 1:16,18</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> Men ought not to content themselves with a general repentance,
but it is every man's duty to endeavor to repent of his particular sins,
particularly.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup>

<ol start="10">
    <li id="10">Psa 19:13; Luk 19:8; 1Ti 1:13,15</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VI.</span> As every man is bound to make private confession of his sins to
God, praying for the pardon thereof;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> upon which, and the
forsaking of them, he shall find mercy;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> so he that scandelizeth his
brother, or the Church of Christ, ought to be willing, by a private or
public confession and sorrow for his sin, to declare his repentance to
those that are offended;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> who are thereupon to be reconciled to
him, and in love to receive him.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Good Works</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">Good</span> works are only such as God has commanded in His holy
Word,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and not such as, without the warrant thereof, are devised
by men, out of blind zeal, or upon any pretence of good intention.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Mic 6:8; Rom 12:2; Heb 13:21</li>

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> These good works, done in obedience to God's commandments,
are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and by them
believers manifest their thankfulness,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> strengthen their assurance,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>
edify their brethren,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> adorn the profession of the Gospel,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> stop the
mouths of the adversaries,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> and glorify God,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> whose workmanship
they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup>
that, having their fruit
unto holiness, they may have the end, eternal life.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup>

<ol start="3">
    <li id="3">Jam 2:18,22</li> 
    <li id="4">Psa 116:12,13; 1Pe 2:9</li>

    <li id="10">Eph 2:10</li> 
    <li id="11">Rom 6:22</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but
wholly from the Spirit of Christ.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> And that they may be enabled
thereunto, beside the graces they have already received, there is
required an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in them
to will, and to do, of His good pleasure:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> yet are they not hereupon
to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty
unless upon a special motion of the Spirit; but they ought to be
diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup>

<ol start="12">
    <li id="12">Joh 15:4,5,6; Eze 36:26,27</li>

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> They who, in their obedience, attain to the greatest height which
is possibly in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate,
and to do more than God requires, as that they fall short of much
which in duty they are bound to do.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup>

<ol start="15">
    <li id="15">Luk 17:10; Neh 13:22; Job 9:2,3; Gal 5:17</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> We cannot by our best works merit pardon of sin, or eternal life at
the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is
between them and the glory to come; and the infinite distance that is
between us and God, whom, by them, we can neither profit, nor
satisfy for the debt of our former sins,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> but when we have done all
we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup>
and because, as they are good, they proceed from His Spirit,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> and
as they are wrought by us, they are defiled, and mixed with so much
weakness and imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of
God's judgment.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup>

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VI.</span> Notwithstanding, the persons of believers being accepted through
Christ, their good works also are accepted in Him;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> not as though
they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreproveable in God's
sight;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> but that He, looking upon them in His Son, is pleased to
accept and reward that which is sincere, although accompanied with
many weaknesses and imperfections.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup>

them they may be things which God commands; and of good use
both to themselves and others:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> yet, because they proceed not
from an heart purified by faith;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> nor are done in a right manner,
according to the Word;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> nor to a right end, the glory of God,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup>
they are therefore sinful and cannot please God, or make a man
meet to receive grace from God:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> and yet, their neglect of them is

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> This perseverance of the saints depends not upon their own free
will, but upon the immutability of the decree of election, flowing from
the free and unchangeable love of God the Father;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> upon the
efficacy of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>
the abiding
of the Spirit, and of the seed of God within them,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> and the nature of
the covenant of grace:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Assurance of Grace and Salvation</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">Although</span> hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly
deceive themselves with false hopes and carnal presumptions of
being in the favor of God, and estate of salvation<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>
(which hope of
theirs shall perish):<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> yet such as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and
love Him in sincerity, endeavouring to walk in all good conscience
before Him, may, in this life, be certainly assured that they are in the
state of grace,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and may rejoice in the hope of the glory of God,
which hope shall never make them ashamed.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Job 8:13,14; Mic 3:11; Deut 29:19; Joh 8:41</li>

    <li id="4">Rom 5:2,5</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion
grounded upon a fallible hope;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> but an infallible assurance of faith
founded upon the divine truth of the promises of salvation,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>
the
inward evidence of those graces unto which these promises are
made,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup>
the testimony of the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our
spirits that we are the children of God,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> which Spirit is the earnest
of our inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> This infallible assurance does not so belong to the essence of
faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many
difficulties, before he be partaker of it:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> yet, being enabled by the
Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may,
without extraordinary revelation in the right use of ordinary means,
attain thereunto.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> And therefore it is the duty of every one to give
all diligence to make his calling and election sure,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup>
that thereby his
heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in love
and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the
duties of obedience,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup>
the proper fruits of this assurance; so far is it
from inclining men to looseness.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup>

ways shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as, by negligence in
preserving of it, by falling into some special sin which wounds the
conscience and grieves the Spirit; by some sudden or vehement
temptation, by God's withdrawing the light of His countenance, and
suffering even such as fear Him to walk in darkness and to have no
light:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> yet are they never so utterly destitute of that seed of God,

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of the Law of God</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">God</span> gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which He
bound him and all his posterity, to personal, entire, exact, and
perpetual obedience, promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatened
death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability
to keep it.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

<ol start="1">

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> This law, after his fall, continued to be a perfect rule of
righteousness; and, as such, was delivered by God upon Mount
Sinai, in ten commandments, and written in two tables:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>
the first
four commandments containing our duty towards God; and the other
six, our duty to man.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

    <li id="3">Mat 22:37-40</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> Besides this law, commonly called moral, God was pleased to
give to the people of Israel, as a church under age, ceremonial laws,
containing several typical ordinances, partly of worship, prefiguring
Christ, His graces, actions, sufferings, and benefits;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> and partly,
holding forth divers instructions of moral duties.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> All which
ceremonial laws are now abrogated, under the New Testament.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<ol start="4">
    <li id="4">Heb 9; Heb 10:1; Gal 4:1,2,3; Col 2:17</li>

    <li id="6">Col 2:14,16,17; Dan 9:27; Eph 2:15,16</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> To them also, as a body politic, He gave sundry judicial laws,
which expired together with the State of that people; not obliging
under any now, further than the general equity thereof may require.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup>

<ol start="7">
    <li id="7">Eod 21; Exod 22:1-29; Gen 49:10 with 1Pe 2:13,14; Mat 5:17 with Mt 5:38,39; 1Co 9:8-10</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> The moral law does forever bind all, as well justified persons as
others, to the obedience thereof;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> and that, not only in regard of the
matter contained in it, but also in respect of the authority of God the
Creator, who gave it.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Neither does Christ, in the Gospel, any way
dissolve, but much strengthen this obligation.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup>

<ol start="8">

    <li id="10">Mat 5:17,18,19; Jam 2:8; Rom 3:31</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VI.</span> Although true believers be not under the law, as a covenant of
works, to be thereby justified, or condemned;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> yet is it of great use
to them, as well as to others; in that, as a rule of life informing them
of the will of God, and their duty, it directs and binds them to walk
accordingly;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> discovering also the sinful pollutions of their nature,
hearts and lives;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> so as, examining themselves thereby, they may
come to further conviction of, humiliation for, and hatred against sin,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup>
together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and
the perfection of His obedience.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup>
It is likewise of use to the
regenerate, to restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids sin:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and
the threatenings of it serve to show what even their sins deserve;
and what afflictions, in this life, they may expect for them, although
freed from the curse thereof threatened in the law.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> The promises
of it, in like manner, show them God's approbation of obedience,and
what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup>
although not as due to them by the law as a covenant of works.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup>
So as, a man's doing good, and refraining from evil, because the law
encourages to the one and deters from the other, is no evidence of
his being under the law: and not under grace.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">The</span> liberty which Christ has purchased for believers under the
Gospel consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, and
condemning wrath of God, the curse of the moral law;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and, in their
being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and
dominion of sin;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>
from the evil of afflictions, the sting of death, the
victory of the grave, and everlasting damnation;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> as also, in their
free access to God,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> and their yielding obedience unto Him, not out
of slavish fear, but a child-like love and willing mind.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> All which were
common also to believers under the law.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> But, under the New
Testament, the liberty of Christians is further enlarged, in their
freedom from the yoke of the ceremonial law, to which the Jewish
Church was subjected;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> and in greater boldness of access to the
throne of grace,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of
God, than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> God alone is Lord of the conscience,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> and has left it free from
the doctrines and commandments of men, which are, in any thing,
contrary to His Word; or beside it, if matters of faith, or worship.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup>
So that, to believe such doctrines, or to obey such commands, out of
conscience, is to betray true liberty of conscience:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> and the
requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is
to destroy liberty of conscience, and reason also.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> They who, upon pretence of Christian liberty, do practice any sin,
or cherish any lust, do thereby destroy the end of Christian liberty,
which is, that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we
might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness
before Him, all the days of our life.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup>

mutually to uphold and preserve one another, they who, upon
pretence of Christian liberty, shall oppose any lawful power, or the
lawful exercise of it, whether it be civil or ecclesiastical, resist the
ordinance of God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> And, for their publishing of such opinions, or
maintaining of such practices, as are contrary to the light of nature,

worship, or conversation), or to the power of godliness; or, such
erroneous opinions or practices, as either in their own nature, or in
the manner of publishing or maintaining them, are destructive to the
external peace and order which Christ has established in the Church,
they may lawfully be called to account,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and proceeded against, by

<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">The</span> light of nature shows that there is a God, who has lordship
and sovereignty over all, is good, and does good unto all, and is
therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and
served, with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the might.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted
by Himself, and so limited by His own revealed will, that He may not
be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or
the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representation, or any
other way not prescribed in the holy Scripture.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of lawful Oaths and Vows</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">A lawful</span> oath is part of religious worship,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> wherein, upon just
occasion, the person swearing solemnly calls God to witness what
he asserts, or promises, and to judge him according to the truth or
falsehood of what he swears.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Deut 10:20</li> 
    <li id="2">Exo 20:7; Lev 19:12; 2Co 1:23; 2Ch 6:22,23</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear, and
therein it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> Therefore,
to swear vainly, or rashly, by that glorious and dreadful Name; or, to
swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Yet,
as in matters of weight and moment, an oath is warranted by the
Word of God, under the New Testament as well as under the old;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>
so a lawful oath, being imposed by lawful authority, in such matters,
ought to be taken.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<ol start="3">

    <li id="6">1Ki 8:31; Neh 13:25; Ezr 10:5</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> Whosoever takes an oath ought duly to consider the weightiness
of so solemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is
fully persuaded is the truth:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> neither may any man bind himself by
oath to any thing but what is good and just, and what he believes so
to be, and what he is able and resolved to perform.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> Yet it is a sin
to refuse an oath touching any thing that is good and just, being
imposed by lawful authority.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup>

    <li id="9">Num 5:19,21; Neh 5:12; Exo 22:7-11</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the
words, without equivocation, or mental reservation.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup>
It cannot
oblige to sin; but in any thing not sinful, being taken, it binds to
performance, although to a man's own hurt.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> Not is it to be
violated, although made to heretics, or infidels.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup>

<ol start="10">
    <li id="10">Jer 4:2; Psa 24:4</li>

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> A vow is of the like nature with a promissory oath, and ought to be
made with the like religious care, and to be performed with the like
faithfulness.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup>

<ol start="13">
    <li id="13">Isa 19:21; Ecc 5:4,5,6; Psa 61:8; Psa 66:13,14</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VI.</span> It is not to be made to any creature, but to God alone:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> and
that it may be accepted, it is to be made voluntarily, out of faith, and
conscience of duty, in way of thankfulness for mercy received, or for
the obtaining of what we want, whereby we more strictly bind
ourselves to necessary duties: or, to other things, so far and so long
as they may fitly conduce thereunto.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup>

<ol start="14">

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VII.</span> No man may vow to do any thing forbidden in the Word of God,
or what would hinder any duty therein commanded, or which is not in
his own power, and for the performance whereof he has no promise
of ability from God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup>
In which respects, popish monastical vows of
perpetual single life, professed poverty, and regular obedience, are
so far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are
superstitious and sinful snares, in which no Christian may entangle
himself.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">God</span>, the supreme Lord and King of all the world, has ordained civil
magistrates, to be, under Him, over the people, for His own glory,
and the public good: and, to this end, has armed them with the
power of the sword, for the defence and encouragement of them
that are good, and for the punishment of evil doers.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Rom 13:1-4; 1Pe 2:13,14</li> 
</ol> 

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> It is lawful for Christians to accept and execute the office of a
magistrate, when called thereunto:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>
in the managing whereof, as
they ought especially to maintain piety, justice, and peace, according
to the wholesome laws of each commonwealth;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> so, for that end,

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> Civil magistrates may not assume to themselves the
administration of the Word and sacraments; or the power of the
keys of the kingdom of heaven;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> yet he has authority, and it is his
duty, to take order that unity and peace be preserved in the Church,
that the truth of God be kept pure and entire, that all blasphemies

and discipline prevented or reformed, and all the ordainances of God
duly settled, administrated, and observed.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> For the better effecting
whereof, he has power to call synods, to be present at them and to

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Marriage and Divorce</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">Marriage</span> is to be between one man and one woman: neither is it
lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman
to have more than one husband, at the same time.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Gen 2:24; Mat 19:5,6; Pro 2:17</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>
for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue, and of the
Church with an holy seed;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and for preventing of uncleanness.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

<ol start="2">
    <li id="2">Gen 2:18</li> 
    <li id="3">Mal 2:15</li> 
    <li id="4">1Co 7:2,9</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry, who are able with
judgment to give their consent.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> Yet it is the duty of Christians to
marry only in the Lord.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> And therefore such as profess the true
reformed religion should not marry with infidels, papists, or other
idolaters: neither should such as are godly be unequally yoked, by
marrying with such as are notoriously wicked in their life, or maintain
damnable heresies.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup>

<ol start="5">
    <li id="5">Heb 13:4; 1Ti 4:3; 1Co 7:36,37,38; Gen 24:57,58</li>

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity or
affinity forbidden by the Word.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> Nor can such incestuous marriages
ever be made lawful by any law of man or consent of parties, so as
those persons may live together as man and wife.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> The man may
not marry any of his wife's kindred, nearer in blood then he may of
his own: nor the woman of her husband's kindred, nearer in blood
than of her own.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup>

    <li id="10">Lev 20:19-21</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> Adultery or fornication committed after a contract, being detected
before marriage, gives just occasion to the innocent party to dissolve
that contract.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup>
In the case of adultery after marriage, it is lawful for
the innocent party to sue out a divorce and, after the divorce,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup>
to
marry another, as if the offending party were dead.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VI.</span> Although the corruption of man be such as is apt to study
arguments unduly to put asunder those whom God has joined
together in marriage: yet, nothing but adultery, or such wilful
desertion as can no way be remedied by the Church, or civil
magistrate, is cause sufficient of dissolving the bond of marriage:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup>
wherein, a public and orderly course of proceeding is to be
observed; and the persons concerned in it not left to their own wills,
and discretion, in their own case.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup>

Gospel (not confined to one nation, as before under the law),
consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true
religion;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and of their children:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and is the kingdom of the Lord

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> Unto this catholic visible Church Christ has given the ministry,

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> This catholic Church has been sometimes more, sometimes less
visible.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> And particular Churches, which are members thereof, are
more or less pure, according as the doctrine of the Gospel is taught

<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">All</span> saints, that are united to Jesus Christ their Head, by His Spirit,
and by faith, have fellowship with Him in His grace, sufferings, death,
resurrection, and glory:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and, being united to one another in love,
they have communion in each other's gifts and graces,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and are
obliged to the performance of such duties, public and private, as do
conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and
communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other
spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> as also in
relieving each other in outward things, according to their several
abilities and necessities. Which communion, as God offers
opportunity, is to be extended unto all those who, in every place, call

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> This communion which the saints have with Christ, does not make
them in any wise partakers of the substance of His Godhead; or to
be equal with Christ in any respect: either of which to affirm is
impious and blasphemous.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> Nor does their communion one with

<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">Sacraments</span> are holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>
immediately instituted by God,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>
to represent Christ and His
benefits; and to confirm our interest in Him:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> as also, to put a visible
difference between those that belong unto the Church and the rest of
the world;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> and solemnly to engage them to the service of God in
Christ, according to His Word.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

<ol start="1">

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> There is, in every sacrament, a spiritual relation, or sacramental

other.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacraments rightly used,
is not conferred by any power in them; neither does the efficacy of a
sacrament depend upon the piety or intention of him that does
administer it:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> but upon the work of the Spirit,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> and the word of
institution, which contains, together with a precept authorizing the
use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup>

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> There are only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the

of which may be dispensed by any, but by a minister of the Word
lawfully ordained.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Baptism</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">Baptism</span> is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus
Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> not only for the solemn admission of the party baptized into
the visible Church;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> but also to be unto him a sign and seal of the
covenant of grace,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> of his ingrafting into Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> of regeneration,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>
of remission of sins,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> and of his giving up unto God, through Jesus
Christ, to walk in the newness of life.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> Which sacrament is, by
Christ's own appointment, to be continued in His Church until the end
of the world.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Mat 28:19</li> 
    <li id="2">1Co 12:13</li>

    <li id="8">Mat 28:19,20</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> The outward element to be used in this sacrament is water,
wherewith the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by a minister of the Gospel,
lawfully called thereunto.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup>

<ol start="9">
    <li id="9">Mat 3:11; Joh 1:33; Mat 28:19,20</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary; but
Baptism is rightly administered by pouring, or sprinkling water upon
the person.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup>

<ol start="10">
    <li id="10">Heb 9:10,19,20,21,22; Act 2:41; Acts 16:33; Mar 7:4</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> Not only those that do actually profess faith in and obedience
unto Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> but also the infants of one, or both, believing parents,
are to be baptized.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup>

<ol start="11">
    <li id="11">Mar 16:15,16; Act 8:37,38</li> 
    <li id="12">Gen 17:7,9 with Gal 3:9,14 and Col 2:11,12 and Act 2:38,39 and Rom 4:11,12; 1Co 7:14; Mat 28:19; Mar 10:13-16; Luk 18:15</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> Although it is a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup>
yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as
that no person can be regenerated, or saved, without it:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> or, that
all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup>

<ol start="13">
    <li id="13">Luk 7:30; Exo 4:24-26</li>

    <li id="15">Act 8:13,23</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VI.</span> The efficacy of Baptism is not tied to that moment of time
wherein it is administered;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> yet, notwithstanding, by the right use of
this ordinance, the grace promised is not only offered, but really
exhibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether of age
or infants) as that grace belongs unto, according to the counsel of
God's own will, in His appointed time.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup>

<ol start="16">

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VII.</span> The sacrament of Baptism is but once to be administered unto
any person.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of the Lord's Supper</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">Our</span> Lord Jesus, in the night wherein He was betrayed, instituted
the sacrament of His body and blood, called the Lord's Supper, to
be observed in His Church, unto the end of the world, for the
perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of Himself in His death; the
sealing all benefits thereof unto true believers, their spiritual
nourishment and growth in Him, their further engagement in and to all
duties which they owe unto Him; and, to be a bond and pledge of
their communion with Him, and with each other, as members of His
mystical body.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">1Co 11:23-26; 1Co 10:16,17,21; 1Co 12:13</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> In this sacrament, Christ is not offered up to His Father; nor any
real sacrifice made at all, for remission of sins of the quick or dead;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> but only a commemoration of that one offering up of Himself, by
Himself, upon the cross, once for all: and a spiritual oblation of all
possible praise unto God, for the same:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> so that the popish
sacrifice of the mass (as they call it) is most abominably injurious to
Christ's one, only sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sins of
His elect.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

<ol start="2">
    <li id="2">Heb 9:22,25,26,28</li> 
    <li id="3">1Co 11:24,25,26; Mat 26:26,27</li> 
    <li id="4">Heb 7:23,24,27; Heb 10:11,12,14,18</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> The Lord Jesus has, in this ordinance, appointed His ministers to
declare His word of institution to the people, to pray, and bless the
elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a
common to an holy use; and to take and break the bread, to take
the cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to
the communicants;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> but to none who are not then present in the
congregation.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<ol start="5">
    <li id="5">Mat 26:26,27,28 and Mar 14:22-24 and Luk 22:19,20; 1Co 11:23-26</li> 
    <li id="6">Act 20:7; 1Co 11:20</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> Private masses, or receiving this sacrament by a priest, or any
other alone;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> as likewise, the denial of the cup to the people,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup>
worshipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them
about, for adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended
religious use; are all contrary to the nature of this sacrament, and to
the institution of Christ.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup>

<ol start="7">
    <li id="7">1Co 10:6</li> 
    <li id="8">Mar 14:23; 1Co 11:25,26,27-29</li> 
    <li id="9">Mat 15:9</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the
uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to Him crucified, as that,
truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name
of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of Christ;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup>
albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain truly and only bread
and wine, as they were before.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup>

<ol start="10">
    <li id="10">Mat 26:26-28</li> 
    <li id="11">1Co 11:26,27,28; Mat 26:29</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VI.</span> That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of
bread and wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood
(commonly called transubstantiation) by consecration of a priest, or
by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to
common sense, and reason; overthrows the nature of the
sacrament, and has been, and is, the cause of manifold
superstitions; yes, of gross idolatries.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup>

<ol start="12">
    <li id="12">Act 3:21 with 1Co 11:24-26; Luk 24:6,39</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VII.</span> Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements, in
this sacrament,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> do then also, inwardly by faith, really and indeed,
yet not carnally and corporally but spiritually, receive and feed upon,
Christ crucified, and all benefits of His death: the body and blood of
Christ being then, not corporally or carnally, in, with, or under the
bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of
believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their
outward senses.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup>

<ol start="13">
    <li id="13">1Co 11:28</li> 
    <li id="14">1Co 10:16</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VIII.</span> Although ignorant and wicked men receive the outward
elements in this sacrament; yet, they receive not the thing signified
thereby; but, by their unworthy coming thereunto, are guilty of the
body and blood of the Lord, to their own damnation. Wherefore, all
ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion
with Him, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table; and cannot,
without great sin against Christ, while they remain such, partake of
these holy mysteries,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> or be admitted thereunto.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Church Censures</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">The</span> Lord Jesus, as king and head of His Church, has therein
appointed a government, in the hand of Church officers, distinct from
the civil magistrate.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Isa 9:6,7; 1Ti 5:17; 1Th 5:12; Act 20:17,18; Heb 13:7,17,24; 1Co 12:28; Mat 28:18-20</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> To these officers the keys of the kingdom of heaven are
committed; by virtue whereof, they have power, respectively, to
retain, and remit sins; to shut that kingdom against the impenitent,
both by the Word, and censures; and to open it unto penitent
sinners, by the ministry of the Gospel; and by absolution from
censures, as occasion shall require.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<ol start="2">
    <li id="2">Mat 16:19; Matt 18:17,18; Joh 20:21-23; 2Co 2:6-8</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> Church censures are necessary, for the reclaiming and gaining of
offending brethres, for deterring of others from the like offenses, for
purging out of that leaven which might infect the whole lump, for
vindicating the honor of Christ, and the holy profession of the
Gospel, and for preventing the wrath of God, which might justly fall
upon the Church, if they should suffer His covenant, and the seals
thereof, to be profaned by notorious and obstinate offenders.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

<ol start="3">
    <li id="3">1Cor 5; 1Ti 5:20; Mat 7:6; 1Ti 1:20; 1Co 11:27-34 with Jd 23</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> For the better attaining of these ends, the officers of the Church
are to proceed by admonition; suspension from the sacrament of the
Lord's Supper for a season; and by excommunication from the
Church; according to the nature of the crime, and demerit of the
person.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

<ol start="4">
    <li id="4">1Th 5:12; 2Th 3:6,14,15; 1Co 5:4,5,13; Mat 18:17; Tit 3:10</li>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of Synods and Councils</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">For</span> the better government, and further edification of the Church,
there ought to be such assemblies as are commonly called synods
or councils.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

<ol start="1">
    <li id="1">Act 15:2,4,6</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> As magistrates may lawfully call a synod of ministers, and other
fit persons, to consult and advise with, about matters of religion;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>
so, if magistrates be open enemies to the Church, the ministers of
Christ, of themselves, by virtue of their office, or they, with other fit
persons upon delegation from their Churches, may meet together in
such assemblies.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

<ol start="2">
    <li id="2">Isa 49:23; 1Ti 2:1,2; 2Ch 19:8,9,10,11; 2Ch 29-30; Mat 2:4,5; Pro 11:14</li> 
    <li id="3">Act 15:2,4,22,23,25</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> It belongs to synods and councils, ministerially to determine
controversies of faith, and cases of conscience; to set down rules
and directions for the better ordering of the public worship of God,
and government of his Church; to receive complaints in cases of
maladministration, and authoritatively to determine the same; which
decrees and determinations, if consonant to the Word of God, are to
be received with reverence and submission; not only for their
agreement with the Word, but also for the power whereby they are
made, as being an ordinance of God appointed thereunto in His
Word.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

<ol start="4">
    <li id="4">Act 15:15,19,24,27,28,29,30,31; Ac 16:4; Mat 18:17-20</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">IV.</span> All synods or councils, since the apostles' times, whether general
or particular, may err; and many have erred. Therefore they are not
to be made the rule of faith, or practice; but to be used as a help in
both.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

<ol start="5">
    <li id="5">Eph 2:20; Act 17:11; 1Co 2:5; 2Co 1:24</li> 
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">V.</span> Synods and councils are to handle, or conclude nothing, but that
which is ecclesiastical: and are not to intermeddle with civil affairs
which concern the commonwealth, unless by way of humble petition
in cases extraordinary; or, by way of advice, for satisfaction of
conscience, if they be thereunto required by the civil magistrate.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of the State of Men after Death, and of the Resurrection of the Dead</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">The</span> bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal
subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>
the souls
of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are received
into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light
and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> And the
souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in torments
and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>
Beside these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the
Scripture acknowledges none.

<ol start="1">

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be
changed:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame
bodies, and none other (although with different qualities), which shall
be united again to their souls forever.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Of the Last Judgment</span>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">I.</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;">God</span> has appointed a day, wherein He will judge the world, in
righteousness, by Jesus Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>
to whom all power and judgment is
given of the Father.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>
In which day, not only the apostate angels shall
be judged,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth shall
appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their
thoughts, words, and deeds; and to receive according to what they
have done in the body, whether good or evil.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">II.</span> The end of God's appointing this day is for the manifestation of
the glory of His mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect; and of His
justice, in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and
disobedient. For then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and
receive that fulness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from the
presence of the Lord; but the wicked who know not God, and obey
not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments,
and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of
the Lord, and from the glory of His power.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">III.</span> As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there
shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin; and for
the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> so will He
have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal
security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what
hour the Lord will come; and may be ever prepared to say, Come
Lord Jesus, come quickly, Amen.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup>
