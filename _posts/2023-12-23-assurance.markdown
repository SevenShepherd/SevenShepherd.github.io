<!-- # The Highest Form Of Assurance Can Be Found In Matthew 22:14 (short article) -->

> Do not be deceived, if you are walking after the flesh and involved in the things of the flesh, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you have no assurance of being in the Kingdom of Heaven</span> &mdash; [**Chuck Smith (YouTube Short)**](https://youtube.com/shorts/aBG9kH-z8Q8?si=_jqYQqF6bgbN9TZZ)

<!-- Christ died for the sins of the world (1Jn 2:2), but not everyone goes to heaven. Only those who do the will of the father (Mt 7:21). They do the will of the father when they are saved by genuine saving faith (Eph 2:8-10), which is a trust and reliance that will ‚Äúresult‚Äù in the fruit of obedience to God (Jn 14:15; 1 Jn 2:4). This fruit Jesus spoke about will absolutely spring forth if you have a living faith (John 15:1-17; James 2:14-26) and represents the original definition of *sola fide* or faith alone. All who say otherwise deny the power of the Holy Spirit that indwells the believer upon the moment of faith (Rom. 8:9; 1Cor. 12:13; Eph 1:13-14). 

> No, I tell you; but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">unless you repent</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will</span> all likewise <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">perish</span>. &mdash; Luke 13:3 ESV -->

The following is an excerpt from Chuck Smith's C2000. We also recommend his topical study on [repentance](https://youtu.be/kP8rIIps4Sk?t=130).

> 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don‚Äôt know Him. I really haven‚Äôt seen Him. If I really know Him, then I‚Äôm gonna be free from the practice of sin.**

> 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. So again, don‚Äôt deceive yourself. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">If you are <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">practicing</span> sin, living in sin, you are not of God; you are a part of that rebellion against God, led by Satan.</span>

# Conclusion

If you are unrepentant (Lk 13:3) and you pursue lifestyles of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Gal 5:19-21) **the only assurance you deserve is no assurance**. This is the wake up call that will save your life. You should be told to test to see if your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), to see if you really are trusting in Christ, because if you were, you'd be repentant, you'd carry your cross daily (Mt 10:38; Lk 9:23), you'd be bearing the fruits of obedience (John 15:1-17; James 2:14-26; Jn 14:15; 1 Jn 2:4), and you'd have the assurance of being foreknown (Mt 22:14). These are divine enablements.

> You can say that you are sorry for what you have done but if you continue to do it, that is not true repentance. **Real repentance is being so sorry, so contrite, that you do not do it again. You turn away from it and cease doing it.** If a person declares that they have repented of a certain action or sin, and they continue in that same action, there is good reason to doubt the genuineness of the repentance. It is not a true repentance when you continue in that sin. **Repentance is the first step to salvation.** &mdash; [**Chuck Smith**](https://youtu.be/kP8rIIps4Sk?t=130)

<!-- > &ldquo;For many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo; &mdash; Matthew 22:14 ESV

Tell me, what could give you more assurance than knowing that you're chosen, and that you cannot escape your eternal destiny. Nothing. -->

<!-- If you're repentant, and are not actively pursuing indulgent lifestyles of sin, but are only struggling against sin, this article is not focusing on you. Christians undergo a progressive sanctification of decreasing patterns of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Ro 6:1-2,15). It can be described in the following ways:
- The Holy Spirit works in justified believers the will and the power progressively to renounce sin and to advance in spiritual maturity and Christlikeness. By the process of sanctification God makes believers experientially holy.
- By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.

If you're just beginning the sanctification process, it may be difficult for you to know the difference, the way to tell whether you are being sanctified or using grace as a license to sin and are in danger of false profession, is to examine the following verses (**Jd 4 NET**; 1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;">ungodly men</span> who have turned the grace of our God into a <span style="font-size:1.2em;">license for evil</span></span> and who <span style="font-weight:bold;">deny our only <span style="font-size:1.2em;">Master and Lord</span>, Jesus Christ</span>. &mdash; Jude 1:4 NET

Giving someone false assurance is one of the most evil and depraved things you can do. This ministry will never lie to you, no matter how hard a truth is to hear (Jn 7:7). These hard truths become confidences and comforts at advanced levels of sanctification. -->








<!-- People with no understanding of scripture will attempt to tell you that fruit of being saved is works. This is of course the most rediculous lie you will ever be told. The fruit that springs forth from a true and lively faith is post-justification, and is the evidence that God has given us so that we might have assurance at all. Everything else is blind faith and **giving someone false assurance is one of the most evil and depraved things you can do.** -->
