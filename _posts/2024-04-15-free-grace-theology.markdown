‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: As a protestant who holds to the [five solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg), I believe justification is by grace through faith alone, we developed it from scripture first in history. I also believe that grace is free just like all true Christians do, but this 80s movement brings with it a dangerous set of unbiblical doctrines.

<a name="alone" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 1. The 80's version of the Gospel DOES NOT teach the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith alone</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement **does not teach the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith alone**, because it holds a historically unusual view that is based on a misunderstanding of *alone* in the historic Protestant insistence on "justification by faith alone."

> Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10). &mdash; True Definition Of Faith Alone

‚ö†Ô∏è The full definition that correctly concludes, &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen">but the faith that justifies is never alone</span>*&rdquo; was <span style="color:FireBrick">removed and distorted by the 80s version of the gospel</span>. Faith Alone *&ldquo;resulting&rdquo;* in obedience to God and good works that *&ldquo;follow after&rdquo;* justification was taught for hundreds of years. [Protestant leaders throughout history have consistently defined faith alone as resulting in obedience.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/) I think it should be obvious, that if someone were to tamper with the reformation doctrine of "faith alone," that it would destabilize the soundness of the doctrine.

<!-- The second half of &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***&rdquo; protects us from [**the heresy of antinomianism**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism) (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62). While the first half protects us from legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28). -->

The second half of &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***&rdquo; protects us from [**the heresy of antinomianism**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism).<sup>2</sup> While the first half protects us from legalism.<sup>1</sup>

1. Verses against legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. Verses against antinomianism (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62)
3. Verses for obedience &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; salvation (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10)
4. Verses for Godly dispositions of Love (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35)
5. Verses for Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; Gal 5:22-23)
6. Verses for good works &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; salvation (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)

‚ùå 80's teachers will attempt to convince you that the statement, &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone*&rdquo; is contradictory, politely inform them that they are mistaken, and that both logic and English grammar disagree with their assessment. Then explain the following to them politely:

‚úîÔ∏è There are two different verbs in the two halves of the sentence, which makes it clear that &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; in the first half of the expression is functioning in a different way from &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; in the second half. In the first half &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; modifies &ldquo;*justified,*&rdquo; and in the second half it modifies &ldquo;*is.*&rdquo;

The 80's version of the Gospel distorts sound doctrine (2Tim 4:3-4 NLT) and is possibly leading hundreds of innocent men, women, and children into debauched lifestyles (2Pe 2:1-2 NET) and [antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism). We need to combat this by maintaining the true definition of faith alone. 

<!-- You can also read about how [**Protestant leaders throughout history have consistently defined faith alone as resulting in obedience**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). -->

Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). This has been the teaching of [**Historic Christianity**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/historical-christianity/) for hundreds of years. It is not legalistic despite the confused slander against the truth that you might come across.

<a name="repent" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 2. Does The 80's version of the Gospel teach against Christ's repentance?</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement weakens the gospel message by avoiding any call to unbelievers to repent of their sins. The result is that some followers of *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* teaching have never repented of their sins, and may not be saved. We do not repent to merit or earn our salvation, we repent because our faith is genuine and we have not made a false profession of faith (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4), we repent because our love for God is not superficial (Jn 14:15,21).

> Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">proclaiming the gospel of God</span>, and saying, ‚ÄúThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkRed;">repent</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">and</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkRed;">believe</span> in the gospel.‚Äù &mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Jesus</span> in Mark 1:14-15 ESV preaching and proclaiming that repentance is part of the gospel.

Anyone who can read English can verify that *repentance* does not simply mean a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; All one has to do is inspect [the world's most authoritative Greek lexicons](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) to find that the true meaning of [metano√©≈ç](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [met√°noia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) falls under the second meaning of &ldquo;*feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense)*&rdquo; as taught by Christ & The Apostles.

> Many understand *repentance* to mean simply a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; The weakness of this position is that, for the New Testament, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">this meaning finds no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation</span>, none of which translate metano√©≈ç and met√°noia as &ldquo;*change of mind*&rdquo; for New Testament passages. <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">It is a definition unique to Free Grace supporters</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference works</span>.

### Repentance

[**The true meaning of repentance**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ. Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith. 

> Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

- Not justifying (Rom 3:28; Eph 2:8-10).
- Imperfect (1Jn 1:8‚Äì10; 2:1-2).
- **Taught alongside faith by Christ Himself** (Mark 1:14-15).
- One of the reasons Jesus came (Lk 5:32).
- Taught as [**an inward resolve to turn from sin**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
- **An immediate fruit** of genuine saving faith resulting in good works and righteous behavior (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5).
- **Will happen** in genuine believers (1Jn 3:6-10). logically (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
- **Commanded** by God (Ac 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- **Granted** by God (Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25).
- Growth **given** by God (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4).
- Preached **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Produced from Godly sorrow (2 Cor. 7:10; Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- **Leading to salvation** and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Described as **needed** and necessary (Lk 15:7).
- Repent or Perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Unrepentant sin not tolerated and not a one time event (Lk 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:11-13).

<a name="assurance" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 3. Is The 80's version of the Gospel departing from scripture, indoctrinating innocent children into lifestyles of sin and false assurance?</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement gives false assurance of eternal life to many people who profess faith in Christ but then show no evidence in their pattern of life or even in continuing to say that they believe in Christ. The result is that many people have been assured that they are saved, but they are not.

> Do not be deceived, if you are walking after the flesh and involved in the things of the flesh, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you have no assurance of being in the Kingdom of Heaven</span> &mdash; [**Chuck Smith (YouTube Short)**](https://youtube.com/shorts/aBG9kH-z8Q8?si=_jqYQqF6bgbN9TZZ)

It will help you to make the distinction between **(1)** justification, which is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and **(2)** assurance of salvation, which is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT; Jn 14:15,21). &ldquo;*we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.*... *That is how we know we are living in him.*&rdquo;<sup style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/">‚Ä†</a></sup>

> **Biblical faith is evidence-based.**... **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing.... &mdash; [Dr. John C. Lennox (DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; PhD, University of Cambridge; DSc, Cardiff University)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#lennox)

<a name="trust" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 4. Does The 80's version of the Gospel teach against Christ's *&ldquo;trustful belief&rdquo;* by falsely teaching *&ldquo;assent To Facts&rdquo;* as salvific?</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement leads its supporters to overemphasize one necessary component of genuine faith (mental assent to the Bible's propositions about Christ's atoning work) and to underemphasize another necessary component of genuine faith (namely, heartfelt trust in the living person of Jesus Christ as my Savior and my God). The result is that some followers of the Free Grace movement intellectually agree with the right doctrines, but they have never trusted in Christ as a person, and they are not truly saved.

‚ùå Misguided teachers teach **against** Christ and the lexicon definition of &ldquo;*believe*,&rdquo; by attempting to teach &ldquo;*assent to facts*&rdquo; as salvific, which the Apostle James was clearly against (James 2:19).

‚úîÔ∏è Christ taught &ldquo;*trustful belief*&rdquo; ([pisteu≈ç](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#salvific)) as salvific: (Jn 3:16; 11:25-26). True teaching emphasizes heartfelt trust in the person of Christ, whereas false teaching overemphasizes agreement with facts. We can verify this by inspecting the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicons and dictionaries.

> **2 to entrust oneself to an entity in complete confidence, believe (in), trust,** w. implication of total commitment to the one who is trusted. In our lit. God and Christ are objects of this type of faith that relies on their power and nearness to help, in addition to being convinced that their revelations or disclosures are true. &mdash; Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (**BDAG**), **the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon**

> 4\. piste√∫≈ç means **&ldquo;to trust&rdquo; (also &ldquo;to obey&rdquo;)**, &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; (words), and in the passive &ldquo;to enjoy confidence&rdquo; (cf. the later sense &ldquo;to confide in&rdquo;). &mdash; The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (**TDNT "Kittel"**)

<a name="unlikely" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 5. The 80's version of the Gospel promotes numerous highly unusual, highly unlikely interpretations of Scripture</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement promotes numerous highly unusual, highly unlikely interpretations of the New Testament because of their need to defend a mistaken understanding of the word alone in the phrase "faith alone."

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Under construction - I will update this with examples in time. You could refresh the page in a week or every so often. I will likely make a list of links to future articles here, that expand upon these bad interpretations.

<a name="fruit" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 6. Does The 80's version of the Gospel teach against Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor and against the warnings of the Apostles?</a>

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: there are some moderates within the 80s group that do teach correctly on fruit-bearing, namely, [Charles Ryrie](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#ryrie), see link; however, there is an extremist faction within the 80sFG that is reminiscent of the hyper-grace [antinomians](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism). This section addresses these extremists.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

<!-- becoming reminiscent of false teachers -->

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, is not true faith. It is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26).

Because I already addressed [the heresy of antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruit-bearing/#antinomianism) multiple times, I'm going to briefly cover the topic here:

1. **The Apostle Peter** reveals that false teachers would infiltrate the church, lead many into [debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles, slandering the way of truth with their destructive heresies. In 2 Peter 2 he describes them as, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed&rdquo;*</span> (v. 12), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;springs without water and mists driven by a storm&rdquo;*</span> (v. 17), and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;slaves of depravity&rdquo;*</span> (v. 19). These statements showcase that the subjects were unregenerate professors of the faith. See [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET).
2. **The Apostle John** completely obliterates the extremist 80's version of the Gospel 1 Jn 2:3-6 when he says, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.&rdquo;*</span> He later states, in 1 John 3:7-9, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Little children, let no one deceive you. ... Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, ... No one born of God makes a practice of sinning ...&rdquo;*</span> proving, without a shadow of a doubt, that a true born again has undergone regeneration by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. They no longer &ldquo;*practice*&rdquo; and pursue lifestyles of sin.
3. **The Apostle Jude** in Jd 4 NET calls the church to defend the truth aggressively against this infiltration of dualistic antinomianism when he says, *&ldquo;For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">ungodly men who have turned the grace of our God into a license for evil</span> and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;*
4. **The Apostle Paul** conquers this extremist 80s sect in Romans 6:1-2,15 when he says, &ldquo;*What then? **Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Absolutely not!</span>***&rdquo; Paul also debunks [dispensational antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/dispensationalism/#antinomianism) when he says, *&ldquo;Do we then nullify the law through faith? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Absolutely not!</span> **Instead we uphold the law**.&rdquo;* (Rom 3:31 NET; 1 Cor 6:9‚Äì11; 9:21).

Chuck Smith is a well respected moderate and basic protestant that **is not** a part of this particular 80s movement; although some may see him as a precursor to it, the 80s &ldquo;*free grace*&rdquo; movement [**would not** pass the Chuck Smith test](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/calvary-chapel/). We also recommend his topical study on [repentance](https://youtu.be/kP8rIIps4Sk?t=130).

> 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don‚Äôt know Him. I really haven‚Äôt seen Him. If I really know Him, then I‚Äôm gonna be free from the practice of sin.**
>
> 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. So again, don‚Äôt deceive yourself. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">If you are <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">practicing</span> sin, living in sin, you are not of God; you are a part of that rebellion against God, led by Satan.</span>

Dallas wanted Dr. Grudem to emphasize that the 80s free grace movement, which got it's start at this particular seminary, does not represent this educational institution. Dallas is distancing themselves from this 80s movement.

> I'm doing a presentation here on a
critique of the free grace gospel and
some people haven't heard of this but in
the one hand of course **all Protestants
believe in free grace,** were not saved by
works but by faith, by faith alone, and
it's by God's grace alone but there is a
movement in some parts of the Christian
world it's called the free grace gospel
movement if it actually had its origins
in the modern age from a man named Zane
Hodges who taught at Dallas seminary for
many years now **the people of Dallas want
me to emphasize of course that this
isn't the view of the whole faculty but
it was a view of this professor and some
people who followed him.**

Bob Wilkin (ThM, PhD, Dallas Theological Seminary) has served as an evangelist on the staff of Campus Crusade for Christ, a hospital chaplain, a pastor, and a college professor of Greek and Bible. He is the founder and Executive Director of Grace Evangelical Society (GES).

> Some Free Grace people hold to the change of mind view of repentance, which I advocated in my doctoral dissertation at DTS in 1985. (<span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">I repented of that view in 1998</span>. &mdash; [Dr. Bob Wilikin, C. S. Lewis Said Repentance Is a Condition for Everlasting Life](https://faithalone.org/blog/c-s-lewis-said-repentance-is-a-condition-for-everlasting-life/)

> As one who has held both views, I now see that the idea that the change-of-mind view is easy to explain is not quite right. It is hard to convince someone that repentance is a change of mind about Christ when so many (actually <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">all</span>) <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">NT passages clearly contradict that definition.</span> Actually the view of repentance advocated here is much easier to explain and is much simpler. &mdash; [Dr. Bob Wilikin, Does Your Mind Need Changing? Repentance Reconsidered.](https://faithalone.org/journal-articles/does-your-mind-need-changing/) 

> I have received a number of letters and calls from people who are upset that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">I have abandoned the change-of-mind view</span>. To all such people I wish to say that I personally understand their angst. I held the change-of-mind view for years, even writing a doctoral dissertation defending it. When confronted with the view that I now advocate, I was skeptical. However, I have always considered Acts 17:11 to be a vitally important attitude to have: ‚ÄúThese were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.‚Äù After following that admonition, I changed my thinking about repentance &mdash; [Dr. Bob Wilikin, Does Your Mind Need Changing? Repentance Reconsidered.](https://faithalone.org/journal-articles/does-your-mind-need-changing/) 

I'm happy to see people waking up from this error, especially from the very camp that is wrongfully propagating it.

<a name="conclusion" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 9. Summary & Conclusions</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement departs from scripture and, in my experience, has lead them to believe terribly destructive things about their walk with Christ. It saddens me greatly to see this happening. Because of these concerns, I cannot recommend 80s *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* version of the gospel, or the 80s *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement, as a legitimate option for evangelicals to accept and follow.

> ‚ÄúThe so-called Free Grace version of the gospel of Jesus Christ is unbiblical, anti-evangelical, and sub-Christian, ...‚Äù ‚Äî J.I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford) Time magazine top 25 evangelical.

I recommend moderate forms of Protestantism instead, like, [Amyraldism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/), the [original Calvary Chapel distinctive](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/calvary-chapel/), or [Reformed Wesleyanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/) where there is safety in scripture, the academic community, and centuries of sound doctrine.

<!-- If you find yourself lost in this 80's movement, I would urge you to leave it for safe moderate forms of protestantism instead, like, [Amyraldism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/), the [original Calvary Chapel distinctive](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/calvary-chapel/), or [Reformed Wesleyanism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed-wesleyan/) where there is safety in scripture, the academic community, and centuries of sound doctrine. -->

<!-- A Summary of why the 80s version of the gospel is harmful to Christianity

The New Testament clearly and repeatedly teaches the following two points, which differ with the heart of the 80s Free Grace Gospel:

1) Repentance from sin (in the sense of remorse for sin (2 Cor. 7:10) and an internal resolve to forsake it) is necessary for saving faith,

and

2) Saving faith ‚Äúresults‚Äù in (not ‚Äúincludes‚Äù) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that ‚Äúfollow after‚Äù (not ‚Äúmerits‚Äù) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).

These two points are entirely consistent with the great Reformation teaching that "we are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone." 

The mistakes of the Free Grace movement today all stem from a misunderstanding of the way the word alone is used in the expression "justification by faith alone."

My concerns are organized into five points, covering one historical concern and four practical concerns, as follows. -->
