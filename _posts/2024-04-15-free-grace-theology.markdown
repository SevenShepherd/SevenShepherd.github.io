‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: As a Protestant who holds to the [five solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg), I believe justification is by grace through faith alone, we developed it from scripture first in history. I also believe that grace is free just like all true Christians do, but this 80s movement brings with it a dangerous set of unbiblical doctrines.

<a name="alone" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 1. The 80's version of the Gospel DOES NOT teach the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith alone</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement **does not teach the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith alone**, because it holds a historically unusual view that is based on a misunderstanding of *alone* in the historic Protestant insistence on "justification by faith alone." <span style="color:FireBrick">They've mysteriously removed the second part of the doctrine of faith alone.</span>

<!-- ‚ö†Ô∏è The full definition that correctly concludes, &ldquo;*... <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen">but the faith that justifies is never alone</span>*&rdquo; was <span style="color:FireBrick">mysteriously removed by the 80s version of the gospel</span>. Faith Alone *&ldquo;resulting&rdquo;* in obedience to God and good works that *&ldquo;follow after&rdquo;* justification was taught for hundreds of years. -->

> **We are justified by faith alone** (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen">but the faith that justifies is never alone</span> (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
>> Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen">but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified</span> (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

> &mdash; True Definition Of The Historic Protestant Sola Fide or Faith Alone.

The second half of the sentence, &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***,&rdquo; means that other things always accompany saving faith. Namely, saving faith is always &ldquo;**followed by**&rdquo; changes in a person's conduct of life. That is to say, saving faith is never alone in a person, for *some good works (fruits) will always accompany saving faith in a person's life* and will be seen &ldquo;**after**&rdquo; a person comes to faith.

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:orangered;">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag), <span style="color:#00cc44;">Historic Protestant Position</span>.

While the Reformers always took &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; to mean that faith is the only thing that God responds to, historic protestant teaching has never taken &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;*faith that occurs by itself* in a person, unaccompanied by other human activities&rdquo;

[Protestant leaders throughout history have consistently defined faith alone as being only about justification and then as resulting in obedience by the transformative power of the Holy Spirit.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/) I think it should be obvious, that if someone were to tamper with the reformation doctrine of "faith alone," that it would destabilize the soundness of the doctrine.

<!-- The second half of &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***&rdquo; protects us from [**the heresy of antinomianism**](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html) (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62). While the first half protects us from legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28). -->

The second half of &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, **but the faith that justifies is never alone***&rdquo; protects us from [**the heresy of antinomianism**](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html).<sup>2</sup> While the first half protects us from legalism.<sup>1</sup>

2. Verses against antinomianism (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62)
3. Verses for obedience &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; salvation (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10)
4. Verses for Godly dispositions of Love (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35)
5. Verses for Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; Gal 5:22-23)
6. Verses for good works &ldquo;*after*&rdquo; salvation (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)

‚ùå Misguided teachers will attempt to convince you that the statement, &ldquo;*We are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone*&rdquo; is contradictory, politely inform them that they are mistaken, and that both logic and English grammar disagree with their assessment. Then explain the following to them politely:

‚úîÔ∏è There are two different verbs in the two halves of the sentence, which makes it clear that &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; in the first half of the expression is functioning in a different way from &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; in the second half. In the first half &ldquo;*faith alone*&rdquo; modifies &ldquo;*justified,*&rdquo; and in the second half it modifies &ldquo;*is.*&rdquo;

<!-- You can also read about how [**Protestant leaders throughout history have consistently defined faith alone as resulting in obedience**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). -->

Justification is by [faith alone](/assets/images/solas.jpg) (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.

Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). [Sola fide](/assets/images/solas.jpg). 

<!-- Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).

<!-- Saving faith "results" in obedience to God and good works that "follow after" justification. -->

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me**. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.‚Äù &mdash; John 14:21 NLT (cf. Jn 14:15).

While works definitely **do not** save us, they do spring forth from a true and lively faith.

- Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). This has been the teaching of [**Historic Christianity**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/historical-christianity/) for hundreds of years. It is not legalistic. Necessarily follows is not meritoriously contributes.
- Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
- The practice of unrepentant sin was not tolerated by the Apostles (1 Cor. 5:12-13; Luke 17:3-4)
- Those who practice lifelong habitual sin are likely self-deceived (James 1:22; 2 Pe 2:21-22) and will not inherit the kingdom of God (Mt 18:3; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5 ... + Rev 21:8; 22:15; Ro 1:29-32)
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (Mt 10:38; 16:24; Lk 9:23,62; 14:27; Mk 8:34... Mt 3:10; 25:30; Jn 15:8 ESV)
- True Christians love God by obeying him (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4).
- True Christians love other believers (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10,14; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35).
- The Bible teaches us to live Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; 2 Pe 2:21-22).
- The teaching of obedience to God after justification is not burdensome, in fact it's a reason for joy (1 Jn 5:3-4; Jn 15:10-11).

The 80's version of the Gospel diminishes sound doctrine (2Tim 4:3-4 NLT) and is possibly leading hundreds of innocent men, women, and children into [debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles (2Pe 2:1-2 NET) and [antinomianism](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html). We need to combat this by maintaining the true definition of faith alone. 

<a name="repent" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 2. Does The 80's version of the Gospel teach against Christ's repentance?</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement weakens the gospel message by avoiding any call to unbelievers to repent of their sins. We do not repent to merit or earn our salvation, we repent because our faith is genuine and we have not made a false profession of faith (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4), we repent because our love for God is not superficial (Jn 14:15,21). The result is that **some** followers of *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* teaching have never repented of their sins, and are not saved, because the Holy Spirit works repentance in the hearts of those with genuine faith.

> Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">proclaiming the gospel of God</span>, and saying, ‚ÄúThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkRed;">repent</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">and</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:DarkRed;">believe</span> in the gospel.‚Äù &mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Jesus</span> in Mark 1:14-15 ESV preaching and proclaiming that repentance is part of the gospel.

Anyone who can read English can verify that *repentance* does not simply mean a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; All one has to do is inspect [the world's most authoritative Greek lexicons](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) to find that the true meaning of [metano√©≈ç](/assets/images/greek/metanoeo.png) and [met√°noia](/assets/images/greek/metanoia.png) falls under the second meaning of &ldquo;*feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense)*&rdquo; as taught by Christ & The Apostles.

> Many understand *repentance* to mean simply a &ldquo;*change of mind*.&rdquo; The weakness of this position is that, for the New Testament, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">this meaning finds no support in any authoritative Greek lexicon or in any modern English translation</span>, none of which translate metano√©≈ç and met√°noia as &ldquo;*change of mind*&rdquo; for New Testament passages. <span style="font-style:italic;color:darkred;">It is a definition unique to Free Grace supporters</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">without scholarly support from the academic community or any standard Greek reference works</span>.

### Repentance

[**The true meaning of repentance**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ. Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith. 

> Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).

- Not justifying (Rom 3:28; Eph 2:8-10).
- Imperfect (1Jn 1:8‚Äì10; 2:1-2).
- **Taught alongside faith by Christ Himself** (Mark 1:14-15).
- One of the reasons Jesus came (Lk 5:32).
- Taught as [**an inward resolve to turn from sin**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/) (Ac 3:19; 26:20; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
- **An immediate fruit** of genuine saving faith resulting in good works and righteous behavior (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5).
- **Will happen** in genuine believers (1Jn 3:6-10). logically (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
- **Commanded** by God (Ac 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- **Granted** by God (Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25).
- Growth **given** by God (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5).
- Preached **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- **Produced from Godly sorrow** (2 Cor. 7:10; Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- **Leading to salvation** and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Described as **needed** and necessary (Lk 15:7).
- Repent or Perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Unrepentant sin not tolerated by the Apostles and not a one time event (Lk 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:11-13). 

<a name="wilikin" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">üö∂üìú 2.1 How C.S. Lewis Helped Bob Wilikin Repent Of His Mistaken View On Repentance</a>

Bob Wilkin (ThM, PhD, Dallas Theological Seminary) has served as an evangelist on the staff of Campus Crusade for Christ, a hospital chaplain, a pastor, and a college professor of Greek and Bible. He is the founder and Executive Director of Grace Evangelical Society (GES).

> Some Free Grace people hold to the change of mind view of repentance, which I advocated in my doctoral dissertation at DTS in 1985. (<span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">I repented of that view in 1998</span>. &mdash; [Dr. Bob Wilikin, C. S. Lewis Said Repentance Is a Condition for Everlasting Life](https://faithalone.org/blog/c-s-lewis-said-repentance-is-a-condition-for-everlasting-life/)

> As one who has held both views, I now see that the idea that the change-of-mind view is easy to explain is not quite right. It is hard to convince someone that repentance is a change of mind about Christ when so many (actually <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">all</span>) <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">NT passages clearly contradict that definition.</span> Actually the view of repentance advocated here is much easier to explain and is much simpler. &mdash; [Dr. Bob Wilikin, Does Your Mind Need Changing? Repentance Reconsidered.](https://faithalone.org/journal-articles/does-your-mind-need-changing/) 

> I have received a number of letters and calls from people who are upset that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">I have abandoned the change-of-mind view</span>. To all such people I wish to say that I personally understand their angst. I held the change-of-mind view for years, even writing a doctoral dissertation defending it. When confronted with the view that I now advocate, I was skeptical. However, I have always considered Acts 17:11 to be a vitally important attitude to have: ‚ÄúThese were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.‚Äù After following that admonition, I changed my thinking about repentance &mdash; [Dr. Bob Wilikin, Does Your Mind Need Changing? Repentance Reconsidered.](https://faithalone.org/journal-articles/does-your-mind-need-changing/) 

I'm happy to see people waking up from this error, especially from the very camp that is wrongfully propagating it. Here is the excerpt from ‚ÄúThe Perfect Penitent‚Äù in Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis that opened Wilikin's eyes.

> ... Now what was the sort of "hole" man had got himself into? He had tried to set up on his own, to behave as if he belonged to himself. In other words, fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: he is a rebel who must lay down his arms. Laying down your arms, surrendering, saying you are sorry, realising that you have been on the wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground floor‚Äîthat is the only way out of a "hole." This process of surrender‚Äîthis movement full speed astern‚Äîis what Christians call repentance. Now repentance is no fun at all.
>
> It is something much harder than merely eating humble pie. It means unlearning all the self-conceit and self-will that we have been training ourselves into for thousands of years. It means killing part of yourself, undergoing a kind of death. In fact, it needs a good man to repent. And here comes the catch. Only a bad person needs to repent: only a good person can repent perfectly. The worse you are the more you need it and the less you can do it. The only person who could do it perfectly would be a perfect person‚Äîand he would not need it.
>
> Remember, this repentance, this willing submission to humiliation and a kind of death, is not something God demands of you before He will take you back and which He could let you off if He chose: it is simply a description of what going back to Him is like. If you ask God to take you back without it, you are really asking Him to let you go back without going back. It cannot happen. Very well, then, we must go through with it. But the same badness which makes us need it, makes us unable to do it. Can we do it if God helps us? Yes, but what do we mean when we talk of God helping us? We mean God putting into us a bit of Himself, so to speak. He lends us a little of His reasoning powers and that is how we think: He puts a little of His love into us and that is how we love one another. When you teach a child writing, you hold its hand while it forms the letters: that is, it forms the letters because you are forming them. We love and reason because God loves and reasons and holds our hand while we do it.

It should be stated that **I do not think that 80s &ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo; Theology is a false gospel, only an incomplete, weakened, or diminished one**. I recommend moderate forms of protestantism instead.

> **6\. The Relationship between Dispensationalism and the Free Grace Movement**
>
Historically, the initial source of the Free Grace view of the gospel was apparently not **[redacted]**, its primary advocate in the 1980s and 1990s, but Lewis Sperry Chafer, the first president of Dallas Theological Seminary, especially in his Systematic Theology, where he says, "The New Testament does not impose repentance upon the unsaved as a condition of salvation." However, Chafer's main concern was to deny that repentance had to include "sorrow and heart-anguish," so that "the way of salvation has thus been made impossible for all who do not experience the required anguish." According to Chafer, because of this mistake, people are led "to measure the validity of their salvation by the intensity of anguish which preceded or accompanied it. It is in this manner that sorrow of heart becomes a more subtle form of meritorious work, and to that extent a contradiction of grace.... To imply, as preachers have done so generally, that God must be mollified... by human agony is a desperate form of unbelief."35
>
Although my definition of repentance (p. 865) includes "a heartfelt sorrow for sin," **I would agree with Chafer that we should not tell people to "measure the validity of their salvation by the intensity of the anguish which preceded or accompanied it."** Therefore **I have some sympathy with Chafer's opposition to this pastoral mistake**, which he apparently thought was too prevalent in his day. But I think he over-corrected the mistake by insisting that repentance only required a change of mind.
>
**Chafer was a leading proponent of dispensationalism** (see pp. 656, 1054) and the president of Dallas Theological Seminary from 1924 to 1952, but not all Dallas Seminary faculty or all who advocate Dispensational theology would hold a Free Grace view A controversy over this point erupted in American evangelicalism in 1988 when John MacArthur, himself a Dispensationalist, published The Gospel according to Jesus. This book, which features enthusiastic forewords by J. I. Packer and James Montgomery Boice, strongly criticized the views of writers like Chafer and **[redacted]** on evangelism and the nature of saving faith. MacArthur argued (I think convincingly) from many New Testament passages that one cannot truly accept Christ as Savior without also accepting him as Lord or, in other words, that there can be no true saving faith without genuine repentance in the sense of a commitment to forsake sin and walk in obedience to Christ as well. He said that any other view preaches a cheap gospel that offers unconverted people false security, telling them they are saved simply because they agreed that the facts of the gospel were true or prayed a prayer, but they had no true repentance and no real change of life. MacArthur argued that **such unbiblical evangelism has never been the teaching of the church through history and that the weakened gospel** heard so often as a result of Free Grace teaching has led to a whole generation of professing Christians whose lives are no different from the surrounding culture and who are **really not saved at all**. **[redacted]** quickly responded to MacArthur with another book,
>
**[redacted]**. As I have argued in this chapter, it seems clear that MacArthur was right to maintain that true saving faith in New Testament terms is more than mere intellectual assent to facts; it must include a heartfelt coming to Christ in personal dependence on him for salvation, combined with a heartfelt repentance from sin. **It is misleading to brand this teaching "Lordship salvation" as if it were some new doctrine or as if there were any other kind of salvation&mdash;MacArthur is teaching what has been the historic position of Christian orthodoxy on this matter.** This position is **not salvation by works** but simply states the gospel of free grace and salvation by grace through faith in all its biblical fullness. The change of life that will **result** from genuine conversion does not save us, but it will certainly result if our faith is genuine, for **"faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead" (James 2:17)**.

<a name="assurance" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 3. Is The 80's version of the Gospel indoctrinating innocent children into lifestyles of sin and false assurance, causing them to apostatize?</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement gives false assurance of eternal life to many people who profess faith in Christ but then show no evidence in their pattern of life or even in continuing to say that they believe in Christ. The result is that many people have been assured that they are saved, but they are not.

> Do not be deceived, if you are walking after the flesh and involved in the things of the flesh, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">you have no assurance of being in the Kingdom of Heaven</span> &mdash; [**Chuck Smith (YouTube Short)**](https://youtube.com/shorts/aBG9kH-z8Q8?si=_jqYQqF6bgbN9TZZ)

It will help you to make the distinction between **(1)** justification, which is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and **(2)** assurance of salvation, which is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT; Jn 14:15,21). &ldquo;*we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.*... *That is how we know we are living in him.*&rdquo;<sup style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/">‚Ä†</a></sup>

> **Biblical faith is evidence-based.**... **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing.... &mdash; [Dr. John C. Lennox (DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; PhD, University of Cambridge; DSc, Cardiff University)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#lennox)

If you are unrepentant (Lk 13:3) and you pursue lifestyles of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Gal 5:19-21) the only assurance you have, is no assurance. This is your wake up call (Re 3:3). You should be told to test to see if your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), to see if you really are trusting in Christ, because if you were, you'd be repentant, you'd carry your cross daily (Mt 10:38; Lk 9:23), you'd be bearing the fruits of obedience (John 15:1-17; James 2:14-26; Jn 14:15; 1 Jn 2:4), and you'd have the assurance of being foreknown (Mt 22:14). These are divine enablements.

<a name="trust" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 4. Does The 80's version of the Gospel teach against Christ's *&ldquo;believing trust&rdquo;* by falsely teaching *&ldquo;assent to facts&rdquo;* as salvific?</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement leads its supporters to overemphasize one necessary component of genuine faith (mental assent to the Bible's propositions about Christ's atoning work) and to underemphasize another necessary component of genuine faith (namely, heartfelt trust in the living person of Jesus Christ as my Savior and my God). The result is that some followers of the Free Grace movement intellectually agree with the right doctrines, but they have never trusted in Christ as a person, and they are not truly saved.

‚ùå Misguided teachers teach against the lexicon definition of &ldquo;*believe*,&rdquo; by attempting to teach &ldquo;*assent to facts*&rdquo; as salvific, which the Apostle James was clearly against (James 2:19 NLT).

‚úîÔ∏è Christ taught &ldquo;*trustful belief*&rdquo; ([pisteu≈ç](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#salvific)) as salvific: (Jn 3:16; 11:25-26). True teaching emphasizes heartfelt trust in the person of Christ, whereas false teaching overemphasizes agreement with facts. We can verify this by inspecting the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicons and dictionaries.

> **2 to entrust oneself to an entity in complete confidence, believe (in), trust,** w. implication of total commitment to the one who is trusted. In our lit. God and Christ are objects of this type of faith that relies on their power and nearness to help, in addition to being convinced that their revelations or disclosures are true. &mdash; Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (**BDAG**), **the worlds most authoritative Greek lexicon**

> 4\. piste√∫≈ç means **&ldquo;to trust&rdquo; (also &ldquo;to obey&rdquo;)**, &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; (words), and in the passive &ldquo;to enjoy confidence&rdquo; (cf. the later sense &ldquo;to confide in&rdquo;). &mdash; The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (**TDNT "Kittel"**)

<a name="unlikely" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 5. The 80's version of the Gospel promotes numerous highly unusual, highly unlikely interpretations of Scripture</a>

The 80's *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* movement promotes numerous highly unusual, highly unlikely interpretations of the New Testament because of their need to defend a mistaken understanding of the word alone in the phrase "faith alone." They use this misunderstanding to diminish Christ's call to repentance and His fruit-bearing metaphor. Below you will see proof that scripture goes against the 80's movement.

- [üí¨ ‚ÄúThe times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent‚Äù ‚Äï The Apostle Paul (where there is genuine faith, there is always an inward resolve to turn from sin)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/acts-17-30/)
    - Acts 17 is the Apostle Paul's initial gospel proclamation to the philosophers in Athens. The one and only thing he says that God commands is that they repent from sin (feel remorse, repent, be converted in a religio-ethical sense). Repentance in Paul's preaching is necessary to escape final judgement (See Ac 17:31). This is why it's best to view repentance as a fruit of genuine saving faith, this protects us from legalism and upholds scripture simultaneously.

<a name="fruit" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 6. Does The 80's version of the Gospel teach against Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor and against the warnings of the Apostles?</a>

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: there are some moderates within the 80s group that do teach correctly on fruit-bearing, namely, [Ryrie](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#ryrie), see link; however, there is an extremist faction within the sect that is reminiscent of the hyper-grace [antinomians](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html). This section addresses these extremists.

<!-- > As Ryrie put it, "**Saving faith is a working faith**, and those works justify believers in the courtroom on earth," and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">an "unproductive faith is a spurious faith."</span> &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Four Views On Eternal Security. p. 107. <sup style="color:#A8A8A8;"><sup>45</sup>Ryrie, So GreatSalvation, 110-11.</sup> -->

> As Charles Ryrie correctly observed, <span style="font-weight:bold;">"every Christian will bear fruit; <span style="color:orangered;">otherwise he or she is not a true believer."</span></span> For 'fruit, then, furnishes evidence of saving faith. The evidence may be strong or weak, erratic or regular, visible or not. But a **saving faith works**," &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Four Views On Eternal Security. p. 105.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

<!-- becoming reminiscent of false teachers -->

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.

Because I already addressed [the heresy of antinomianism](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html) multiple times, I'm going to briefly cover the topic here:

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But false prophets arose among the people, just as <span style="font-weight:bold;">there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">even to the point of denying the <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Master</span> who bought them</span>.

Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. &mdash; [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET)

1. **The Apostle Peter** reveals that false teachers would infiltrate the church, lead many into [debauched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/debauched) lifestyles, slandering the way of truth with their destructive heresies. In 2 Peter 2 he describes them as, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed&rdquo;*</span> (v. 12), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;springs without water and mists driven by a storm&rdquo;*</span> (v. 17), and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;slaves of depravity&rdquo;*</span> (v. 19). These statements showcase that the subjects were unregenerate professors of the faith.
2. **The Apostle John<sup>[[1]](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/) [[2]](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/1-John-2-4/)</sup>** completely obliterates antinomianism in 1 Jn 2:3-6 when he says, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.&rdquo;*</span> He later states, in 1 John 3:7-9, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">*&ldquo;Little children, let no one deceive you. ... Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, ... No one born of God makes a practice of sinning ...&rdquo;*</span> proving, without a shadow of a doubt, that a true born again has undergone regeneration by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. They no longer &ldquo;*practice*&rdquo; and pursue lifestyles of sin.
3. **The Apostle Jude** in Jd 4 NET calls the church to defend the truth aggressively against this infiltration of dualistic antinomianism when he says, *&ldquo;For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">ungodly men who have turned the grace of our God into a license for evil</span> and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;*
4. **The Apostle Paul** conquers this extremism in Romans 6:1-2,15 when he says, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">&ldquo;What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Absolutely not!</span>&rdquo;</span> Paul also debunks [dispensational antinomianism](https://www.gotquestions.org/antinomianism.html) when he says, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">&ldquo;Do we then nullify the law through faith? <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">Absolutely not!</span> Instead we uphold the law.&rdquo;</span> (Rom 3:31 NET; 1 Cor 6:9‚Äì11; 9:21).

**The Apostle Paul** thoroughly warned New Testament Christians (You & Me). **These warnings were written to people** who would be listening to the New Testament epistles as they were read aloud **in New Testament Churches** (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11; 2 Cor. 13:5; Heb. 3:12; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 3:6, 9-10; 14).

<!-- The reason those who practice such things aren't true born agains, is because the Holy Spirit transforms the believer away from the practice of sin. Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62). -->

Practice in this sense means a lifelong continual pattern. It speaks of the pursuit of a lifestyle of indulgent sin. This does not mean that you will not have sin or that you will be perfect, in fact you may struggle with sin, make mistakes, and even backslide. A true Christian will undergo decreasing patterns of sin (1 John 3:8‚Äì9; cf. Rom. 6:14‚Äì18) in their progressive sanctification. They will not remain in their old way of life (2 Cor. 5:17; 1Jn 3:31).

The Apostle Paul calls on us to examine or test our faith, to see if it is genuine, to see if Jesus is really living in us. If he is, well, then you have a living faith, if not, then you have a dead faith and are disqualified, or fail the test of genuine faith.

> 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don‚Äôt know Him. I really haven‚Äôt seen Him. If I really know Him, then I‚Äôm gonna be free from the practice of sin.**
>
> 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

<a name="dallas" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 7. Dallas Theological Seminary Distanced Itself From The 80s *&ldquo;Free Grace&rdquo;* Movement</a>

Dallas wanted Dr. Grudem to emphasize that the 80s free grace movement, which got it's start at this particular seminary, does not represent this educational institution. Dallas is distancing themselves from this 80s movement.

> I'm doing a presentation here on a
critique of the free grace gospel and
some people haven't heard of this but in
the one hand of course **all Protestants
believe in free grace,** were not saved by
works but by faith, by faith alone, and
it's by God's grace alone but there is a
movement in some parts of the Christian
world it's called the free grace gospel
movement if it actually had its origins
in the modern age from a man named Zane
Hodges who taught at Dallas seminary for
many years now **the people of Dallas want
me to emphasize of course that this
isn't the view of the whole faculty but
it was a view of this professor and some
people who followed him.**

<a name="artificial" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">üö∂üìú 10. Artificial Intelligence Analysis Of My Article</a>

**What is the tone of the article?**

The tone appears to be authoritative and instructive. It emphasizes certain theological points with clarity and conviction, aiming to teach and guide readers in understanding the importance of repentance in the Christian faith. The language used is direct and assertive, indicating a strong stance on the topic being discussed.

--

**Is any of it legalistic?**

The text you provided doesn't seem to promote legalism. It appears to be emphasizing the importance of obedience and good works as fruits of genuine faith, rather than as a means to earn salvation. It's highlighting the biblical teaching that while salvation is by grace through faith alone, true faith results in a transformed life marked by obedience and good works. Legalism, on the other hand, typically involves the belief that strict adherence to religious laws or moral rules is necessary for salvation.

--

**Interpretation**

Your interpretation captures key elements of Jesus' teachings on salvation, repentance, and obedience. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Trustful belief as salvific:** Jesus emphasized belief in Him as essential for salvation, as seen in verses like John 3:16, where belief leads to eternal life. Similarly, in John 5:24, Jesus emphasizes that those who hear His word and believe in Him have eternal life. This theme is consistent in other passages you mentioned.

2. **Repentance alongside faith:** Jesus indeed taught repentance alongside faith. Mark 1:15 records Jesus' proclamation to "repent and believe in the gospel." Luke 13:3 emphasizes the need for repentance, warning that without it, one will perish. This aligns with the understanding of repentance as a turning away from sin and toward God.

3. **Resulting fruit-bearing:** Jesus frequently used the metaphor of fruit-bearing to describe the outcomes of genuine faith. In John 15:1-17, He speaks of believers abiding in Him, which results in bearing much fruit. This is often interpreted as the outward manifestation of a transformed life.

4. **Resulting obedience:** Jesus also emphasized the importance of obedience as a natural outgrowth of true faith. In John 14:15, He says, "If you love me, you will keep my commandments," highlighting the link between love, faith, and obedience.

Your interpretation aligns well with these aspects of Jesus' teachings, showing a comprehensive understanding of His message regarding salvation, repentance, and the Christian life.

- The Bible is against the heresy of legalism, but supports Christ's fruit-bearing metaphor of resulting obedience to God.
    - Justification is by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Saving faith &ldquo;*results*&rdquo; in (**not** &ldquo;*includes*&rdquo;) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that &ldquo;*follow after*&rdquo; (**not** &ldquo;*merits*&rdquo;) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
    - True Christians love God by obeying him (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).
    - Obedience does not merit salvation, the Holy Spirit produces obedience (1Cor 3:6-7; Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5, Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4).
    - Faith is not a work (Romans 4:5), and repentance is a fruit (Mt 3:8-10 NLT).
- Repentance is the immediate fruit of a genuine non-superficial faith.
    - Repentance is the &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruit of genuine saving faith. Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5).
    - Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
    - The message that &lsquo;*There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.*&rsquo; should be preached to the entire world in the name of Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- The Bible is against the heresy of antinomianism.
    - We are set free from sin, but not set free to sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).
    - Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).
    - We are no longer under the law (Ro 6:1-2,14-15; Gal 3:23-25; Gal 5:18; Col 2:14), but we still uphold the law (Romans 3:31).
- Christianity is a call to discipleship (**Mt 10:38 NLT**; Mt 16:24; **Lk 9:23** Lk 9:62; **Lk 14:27**; Mk 8:34... Jn 15:8 ESV; Mt 3:10; 25:30).

<!-- A Summary of why the 80s version of the gospel is harmful to Christianity

The New Testament clearly and repeatedly teaches the following two points, which differ with the heart of the 80s Free Grace Gospel:

1) Repentance from sin (in the sense of remorse for sin (2 Cor. 7:10) and an internal resolve to forsake it) is necessary for saving faith,

and

2) Saving faith ‚Äúresults‚Äù in (not ‚Äúincludes‚Äù) obedience to God (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10), and good works that ‚Äúfollow after‚Äù (not ‚Äúmerits‚Äù) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).

These two points are entirely consistent with the great Reformation teaching that "we are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone." 

The mistakes of the Free Grace movement today all stem from a misunderstanding of the way the word alone is used in the expression "justification by faith alone."

My concerns are organized into five points, covering one historical concern and four practical concerns, as follows. -->
