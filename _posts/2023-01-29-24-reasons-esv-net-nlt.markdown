<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:24px;">The Worlds Most Flawless Formal Equivalent Bible Version Is The ESV, And It Achieved This Near Perfection By Using NET Full Translators' Notes During It's Creation</span>

NET Translators' Notes are decidedly more formal and literal than any one Bible version on its own. I should also include the fact that the NLT has survived every litmus test I could throw at it, and so I consider it to be the very best dynamic equivalent version of the Bible and decided to include it in this group.

> ‚Äú**The extensive and reliable notes in the NET Bible were a wonderful help to our translation team as we worked to prepare the English Standard Version.**‚Äù &mdash; Dr. Wayne Grudem, Harvard & Cambridge educated Research Professor and member of the Translation Oversight Committee of the ESV

<!-- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:32px;">24 Times The ESV & NET Proved To Be Superior To The King James Version</span> -->

<!-- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:32px;">24 Reasons Why I Moved From The KJV To The ESV, NET, & NLT</span> -->

<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-size:24px;">üìú I. Underlying Manuscripts</span>

**The Critical Text is the Greek text that scholars have compiled as closest to the original autograph (manuscripts).** The Textus Receptus is The Greek text that the [Catholic priest Erasmus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus) compiled and [lifelong doctrinal calvinist King James I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Puritans_under_King_James_I) used to create the King James Version (KJV).

- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;">Points 1 - 6</span>

    1. The King James Version was commissioned by [lifelong doctrinal calvinist King James I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Puritans_under_King_James_I) and uses [Catholic priest Erasmus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus) 16th century Textus Receptus which was not historically received by all or even Erasmus himself. There are [27 different and conflicting Textus Receptus'](https://textusreceptusbibles.com/Editions).

        <!-- > **Textus Receptus is the Greek text that stands behind the King James Bible.** Contrary to what its name suggests, it is not the text received by all. Even **Erasmus wasn't pleased** with the production. He never liked it. He admitted it was rushed, that it was precipitated rather than produced. He put in eight years of work. By the end, he was tired. &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Dallas, Ph.D.)](https://zondervanacademic.com/blog/textus-receptus) -->

        > Textus Receptus is the Greek text that stands behind the King James Bible. **Contrary to what its name suggests, it is not the text received by all. Even Erasmus wasn't pleased** ... &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Dallas, Ph.D.)](https://zondervanacademic.com/blog/textus-receptus)

    2. The [Catholic priest Erasmus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus) only used around <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">3 manuscripts</span> to produce the severely anemic Textus Receptus. There are approximately 5000 mss of the Byzantine MT. So it's not actually a Majority text bible by methodology.

        > ... **the NT has about 5,600 extant copies in Greek alone**, ... **10,000 in latin**, **several thousand copies** ... **several hundred thousand** patristic **quotations** ... &mdash; Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Dallas, Ph.D.) paraphrased.

        > If you could stack up all handwritten manuscripts of the New Testament‚ÄîGreek, Syriac, Latin, Coptic, all languages‚Äîhow tall would the stack be? ... I have said in many lectures that it would be the **equivalent of c. 4 & 1/2 Empire State Buildings stacked on top of each other**. &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Dallas, Ph.D.)](https://danielbwallace.com/tag/number-of-new-testament-manuscripts/)

    3. The [Catholic priest Erasmus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus) lacked the last leaf of Revelation, back translated from a defective copy of the Latin Vulgate, and created 20 errors that don't exist in any Greek mss, botching the last 6 verses of revelation.

        > The problem with Erasmus was that he only used really **three manuscripts**. In fact, **the manuscript Erasmus used for the book of Revelation lacked the last leaf**. He was in a rush to get his Greek New Testament published, because he knew there were others trying to get their editions out. Consequently, **he back translated from his defective copy of the Latin Vulgate into Greek for the last six verses of Revelation**. In the process, **he created twenty new textual variants that have not been found in any other manuscripts** ... &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Dallas, Ph.D.)](https://zondervanacademic.com/blog/textus-receptus)

    4. The Masoretic Text is insufficient, by itself, to translate the book of Job correctly without Ugaritic and other cognate languages. In fact there's evidence that the translators were guessing.
        
        >  **I will never trust it** <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[The KJV]</span> **again** in Job. ... The KJV translators had no access to that <span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[Ugaritic]</span>, nor did they have access to other cognate languages for the same purpose (like Akkadian), or the Dead Sea Scrolls. They did the best they could and did it well, but in books like Job, it is easy for someone like me to know **they are just simply guessing in places**. &mdash; [Dr. Michael S. Heiser](https://drmsh.com/bible-versions/) (created Logos Bible Software Interlinears for KJV, NIV, and NKJV)

    5. Israel Wasn‚Äôt Even In Existence When the Most High Divided The Nations! The fact that Israel didn‚Äôt even exist at this point in Gen. 11:1-9, as referenced by Deut. 32:8 KJV, proves that the much older Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) & Septuagint (LXX) are crucial in solving complex issues in the Masoretic Text (MT).
        > The only versions of the Bible that survived my previous [litmus tests](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-best-bible/), that also have the correct "<span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">sons of God</span>" or "<span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">heavenly assembly / court</span>" translation are the: **ESV, NET, and NLT** &mdash; [The Dead Sea Scrolls And Septuagint Solve A Mystery In The Masoretic Text](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/dead-sea-scrolls/).

    6. The mss that the [Catholic priest Erasmus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus) had access to are among the youngest and most error prone mss from the 12th to 16th century as opposed to those in the Critical Text which are mere decades from the crucifixion.

<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-size:24px;">üñãÔ∏è II. Translation</span>

See IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX from my article "[A Thorough Examination On Bible Versions](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-best-bible/)."

- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;">Points 7 - 13</span>

    - Jehovah or Yahweh? The KJV uses a [fake pronunciation](https://alwaysbeready.com/gods-name-jehovah-by-charlie-campbell/) of the Hebrew tetragrammaton several times like the cults do: Ge 22:14; Ex 6:3; Ex 17:15; Jg 6:24; Ps 83:18; Isa 12:2; Isa 26:4.
        
        > The Jewish Encyclopedia: ‚ÄúJehovah‚Äù ‚Äî a mispronunciation of the Hebrew YHWH the name of God. This pronunciation is grammatically impossible. The form ‚ÄòJehovah‚Äô is a **philological impossibility**.‚Äù

        > Encyclopedia Judaica: ‚Äúthe true pronunciation of the tetragrammaton YHWH was **never lost**. **The name was pronounced Yahweh**. It was regularly pronounced this way at least until 586 B.C., as is clear from the Lachish Letters written shortly before this date.‚Äù

        > The New Jewish Encyclopedia: ‚ÄúIt is clear that the word Jehovah is an **artificial composite**.‚Äù

- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;">Points 14 - 18</span>

    - ‚ÄúCome‚Äù or ‚ÄúCome and see‚Äù?
        
        > Revelation 6:1 tc The addition of ‚Äúand see‚Äù (Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·º¥Œ¥Œµ or Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ≤ŒªŒ≠œÄŒµ [kai ide or kai blepe]) to ‚Äúcome‚Äù (·ºîœÅœáŒøœÖ, erchou) in 6:1, 3-5, 7 is a gloss directed to John, i.e., ‚Äúcome and look at the seals and the horsemen!‚Äù But **the command ·ºîœÅœáŒøœÖ is better interpreted as directed to each of the horsemen. The shorter reading also has the support of the better witnesses.** &mdash; NET Translators' Notes 

    - Book Of Life or Tree Of Life?
        
        > Revelation 22:19 **tc** ... The most notorious of these is this reading. It is thus decidedly inauthentic, while **‚Äúthe tree‚Äù of life, found in the best and virtually all Greek mss, is clearly authentic.** ... &mdash; NET Translators' Notes 

    - Wash their robes or Do His commandments?
        
        > ‚ÄòBlessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life,‚Äô **carries us back to the old law**... I might almost say it is **‚Äòmaking the Cross of Christ of none effect.‚Äô** ... Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but by His mercy. He saved us.‚Äô &mdash; MacLaren‚Äôs Expositions (Rev. 22:14)

    - The word Lucifer (Is 14:12 KJV) is not a proper name, but the Latin word for ‚Äòmorning star,‚Äô (Is 14:12 ESV) which literally referred to Venus in the Latin Vulgate. The KJV translators duplicated the word used in the Latin Vulgate instead of translating it. 
        
        > ... the KJV translators were not sure what to make of it, and simply duplicated the word used in the Latin Vulgate ... Lucifer. **It is not a proper name but the Latin word for ‚Äòmorning star.‚Äô** &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Dallas, Ph.D.)](https://bible.org/article/lucifer-devil-isaiah-1412-kjv-argument-against-modern-translations)
    
    - Does God create evil (Is 45:7 KJV) or calamity (Is 45:7 ESV)? 
        
        > The word translated ‚Äúevil‚Äù is from a Hebrew word that means **‚Äúadversity, affliction, calamity, distress, misery.‚Äù** Modern scholarship in conjunction with our oldest and best manuscripts which predate those used in the TR by over a thousand years, reflect this sentiment. It is without a doubt, calamity. &mdash; [Point IX, A Thorough Examination On Bible Versions](https://bit.ly/3BCflQ3)

- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;">Points 19 - 20</span>

    - The importance of Jude 5 and how it demonstrates the interaction between the personages of the Trinity in Gen. 19:24 LEB proving that Jesus is Yahweh God yet again (1Co 10:4-5,9 Hosea 13:4 LEB). See [NET Notes](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%205&version=NET).
        
        > Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Green;">Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.</span> &mdash; Jude 1:5 ESV (English Standard Version)

    - The very potent John 1:18 that further showcases that Jesus is God made manifest in the flesh. This is from [Papyrus 75](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_variants_in_the_New_Testament#Gospel_of_John) ([ùîì75](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_75)) *"The most significant" papyrus of the New Testament to be discovered so far."* as well as [ùîì66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_66).
        
        > No one has ever seen God, but <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Green;">the one and only Son, who is himself God</span> and<span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[a]</span> is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known. &mdash; [NIV, Parallel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A18&version=ESV;NET;EXB;NIV;NLT)

        >  No one has ever seen God. <span style="font-weight:Bold;color:Green;">It is God the only Son</span>,<span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[a]</span> who is close to the Father‚Äôs heart,<span style="color:#bfbfbf;">[b]</span> who has made him known. &mdash; [NRSV, Parallel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A18&version=ESV;NET;EXB;NRSV;NLT)

- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;">Points 21 - 23</span>

    - Remember, that it is the ‚Äúuntaught‚Äù that ultimately end up twisting scripture and forming cults. Scholars are doing the Lord‚Äôs work, what they say has value. This is the primary reason everything I say is accompanied by heavy citation.

        > As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are **unlearned** and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. &mdash; 2 Peter 3:16 KJV

    - We are required to study and rightly divide the word of truth, or as some translations say *"Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth **accurately**."*

        > **Study to shew thyself approved** unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:15 KJV

    - God said knowledge would increase; ergo, modern translations should be more accurate. We know for a fact that as time progresses, knowledge will increase, and so will the accuracy of Bible versions.

        > But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and **knowledge shall be increased**. &mdash; Daniel 12:4 KJV

<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-size:24px;">üë®‚Äçüíª III. Quantitative Linguistic Comparison and Computerized Statistical Analysis</span>

- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;">Point 24</span>

    - According to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [**analysis**](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf) the English Standard Version (ESV) is the most literal formal equivalent bible version on Earth. 

    - **He who wins souls is wise (Pr 11:30 NET)**. How much easier would it be to convey a message to someone with a high reading comprehension score? Especially considering that each of these versions are 99.8% textually pure.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:32px;">Conclusion</span>

The above points dispel any distrust toward the Alexandrian text-type and give credence as to why we should listen to reason and scholarship instead of YouTube conspiracy theory.

> Can you provide evidence or specific examples to back up your claims as I have done for you? It only takes one fact to prove something, and I just gave you over twenty.

The idea that English speakers are required by God to use a Bible translation from 17th century England is utter nonsense. God would have had to re-inspired the Bible through the KJV translators In order for [KJV Onlyism](https://www.gotquestions.blog/KJV-onlyism.html) to be true. We should avoid the cults and YouTube conspiracy theorists and instead align ourselves with sound scholarship.

**The Scriptures are holy**; however, the translations of those holy scriptures are sometimes *"weighed in the balances and found wanting."* Instead of worshipping the creation, we should be trying to get as close as possible to Christ's actual words in the Biblical Hebrew, and Koine Greek Scriptures, not debate hard evidence and logic, clinging to the traditions of men.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:24px;">Recommended Bibles</span>

I recently wrote an [**article**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-best-bible/) detailing the reasoning behind my conclusions on which bible versions I use. A half-year after writing the article, I was pleased to find that our findings matched [**Dr. Heiser's**](https://drmsh.com/bible-versions/) who created the Interlinears for Logos Bible Software. 

> ... I recommend the ESV. For a study Bible, however, I like the NET Bible ... &mdash; Dr. Michael S. Heiser

I've also taken into account quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [**analysis**](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf). I personally own, and **highly recommend**, the following versions as they are the best of their respective [**categories**](https://wiki.logos.com/Bible_Translation_Spectrum):

The recommendations above represent the very best university level scholarship using our oldest and best mss nearest to the original autographs. We recommend that you do not depart from the sound scholarship of reasoned eclecticism, which gave us the Greek Critical text that scholars have compiled as closest to the original manuscripts.

Scholarship has proven that **no cardinal doctrine is affected** by any viable variant. Regardless of what text is used, **Jesus is affirmed as God in the flesh, as rising from the dead bodily, as ascending to heaven and as coming again some day.** 

> "**99.8% of textual variants affect nothing**, most are spelling differences. there's different ways to spell John, there's different ways to spell Mary, they're not going to affect anything, but **the one-fifth of 1% that do affect things are the ones that scholars talk about**. The bottom line is it does not matter in some respects which New Testament you use because **no essential doctrine is jeopardized** by any of these textual variants" &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Dallas, Ph.D.)](https://youtu.be/NikVdhp0YFs)
