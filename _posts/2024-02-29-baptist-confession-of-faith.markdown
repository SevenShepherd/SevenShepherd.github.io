‘I have thought it right to reprint in a cheap form this excellent list of doctrines, which were subscribed to by the Baptist Ministers in the year 1689. We need a banner because of the truth; it may be that this small volume may aid the cause of the glorious gospel by testifying plainly what are its leading doctrines . . . May the Lord soon restore unto His Zion a pure language, and may her watchmen see eye to eye.’ So wrote the young C.H. Spurgeon, then in the second year of his ministry at New Park Street Chapel, Southwark, in a preface addressed to All the Household of Faith, who rejoice in the glorious doctrines of Free Grace with which he prefixed this Confession when he published it in October, 1855.
>
The Confession itself was first compiled by the Elders and Brethren of many congregations of Christians, baptized upon their profession of faith, in London and the country (as they then described themselves) in the year 1677. It was based upon, and drew its inspiration from the Confession drawn up by the Westminster Assembly of Divines a generation earlier, and indeed differs only from it in its teaching upon those matters, such as baptism, the Lord’s Supper, and church government, upon which among the Reformed churches the Baptists differ from the Presbyterians. For fear of persecution, the compilers of the 1677 Confession did not subscribe their names to it, but when, in September, 1689, following the Revolution of the previous year, the Ministers and Messengers of the churches were able to meet in more peaceful times, thirty-seven of them, including all the most eminent Baptist ministers of the day, set their names to the recommendation with which it was circulated among the churches. Thereafter for between 150 and 200 years it remained the definitive Confession of Faith of the Particular (or Calvinistic) Baptist churches of england and Wales.
>
Mr. Spurgeon did not, however, when he republished this Confession, merely preface it with certain words of general commendation. He also addressed to his own church at New Park Street some practical words of advice as to how they should use the Confession. These are still relevant today.
‘This little volume,’ he wrote, ‘is not issued as an authoritative rule, or code of faith, whereby you are to be fettered, but as an assistance to you in controversy, a confirmation in faith, and a means of edification in righteousness. Here the younger members of our church will have a body of divinity in small compass, and by means of the scriptural proofs, will be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in them.
>
Be not ashamed of your faith; remember it is the ancient gospel of the martyrs, confessors, reformers, and saints. Above all, it is the truth of God, against which all the gates of Hell cannot prevail. Let your lives adorn your faith, let your example adorn your creed. Above all live in Christ Jesus, and walk in Him, giving credence to no teaching but that which is manifestly approved of Him, and owned by the Holy Spirit. Cleave fast to the Word of God which is here mapped out for you.’ This new edition of the Confession is sent out as a private venture by a small group of Baptists who are convinced that it has a message for this generation and believe its publication to be long overdue. They hope it will achieve a wide circulation among the churches, and receive the close study which they believe it will richly repay.
>
In England during the 1630’s and the 1640’s Congregationalists and Baptists of Calvinistic persuasion emerged from the Church of England. Their early existence was marked by repeated cycles of persecution at the hands of the established religion of crown and Parliament. The infamous Clarendon Code was adopted in the 1660’s to crush all dissent from the official religion of the state. Periods of rigorous application and intervals of relaxation of these coercive acts haunted Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists alike.
>
Presbyterians and Congregationalists suffered less than did Baptists under this harassment. No little reason for their relative success in resisting government tyranny was their united front of doctrinal agreement. All Presbyterians stood by their Westminster Confession of 1646. Congregationalists adopted virtually the same articles of faith in the Savoy Confession of 1658. Feeling their substantial unity with paedobaptists suffering under the same cruel injustice, Calvinistic Baptists met to publish their substantial harmony with them in doctrine.
A circular letter was sent to particular Baptist churches in England and Wales asking each assembly to send representatives to a meeting in London in 1677. A confession consciously modeled after the Westminster Confession of Faith was approved and published. It has ever since born the name of the Second London Confession. The First London Confession had been issued by seven Baptist congregations of London in 1644. That first document had been drawn up to distinguish newly organized Calvinistic Baptists from the Arminian Baptists and the Anabaptists. Because this second London Confession was drawn up in dark hours of oppression, it was issued anonymously.
A preface to the original publication of 1677 says in part: “. . . It is now many years since diverse of us . . . did conceive ourselves under a necessity of publishing a Confession of our Faith, for the information and satisfaction of those that did not thoroughly understand what our principles were, of had entertained prejudices against our profession . . . This was first put forth about the year 1643, in the name of seven congregations then gathered in London . . .” (These early Baptists were conscious that the 1644 Calvinistic Baptist Confession predated the 1646 Presbyterian Confession and the 1658 Congregationalist Confession).
“Forasmuch as this confession is not now commonly to be had; and also that many others have since embraced the same truth which is owned therein; it was judged necessary by us to join together in giving a testimony to the world of our firm adhering to those wholesome principles . . .”

<a name="CH1" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.6em;color:Black;">Chapter 1.</a><br>
<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 1.</span> The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet they are not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and His will which is necessary unto salvation.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in diversified manners to reveal Himself, and to declare (that) His will unto His church;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which makes the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God’s revealing His will unto His people being now completed.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

<ol start="1">
	<li id="1">2 Tim. 3:15-17; Isa. 8:20; Luke 16:29,31; Eph. 2:20</li>

</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 2.</span> Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are these:

<!-- <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">OF THE OLD TESTAMENT:</span> -->

All of which are given by the inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

<ol start="5">
	<li id="5">2 Tim. 3:16</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 3.</span> The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<ol start="6">
    <li id="6">Luke 24:27,44; Rom. 3:2</li>
</ol>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 4.</span> The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, depends not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received because it is the Word of God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup>

<ol start="7">
	<li id="7">2 Pet. 1:19-21; 2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Thess. 2:13; 1 John 5:9</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 5.</span> We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God to a high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man’s salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and entire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it does abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup>

<ol start="8">
	<li id="8">John 16:13,14; 1 Cor. 2:10-12; 1 John 2:20,27</li>
</ol>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 6.</span> The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for His own glory, man’s salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or traditions of men.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup>

<ol start="9">

	<li id="11">1 Cor. 11:13,14; 1 Cor. 14:26,40</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 7.</span> All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient understanding of them.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup>

<ol start="12">
	<li id="12">2 Pet. 3:16</li>
	<li id="13">Ps. 19:7; Psalm 119:130</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 8.</span> The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old),<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by His singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and search them,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup>

	<li id="18">1 Cor. 14:6,9,11,12,24,28</li>
	<li id="19">Col. 3:16</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 9.</span> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which are not many, but one), it must be searched by other places that speak more clearly.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup>

<ol start="20">
	<li id="20">2 Pet. 1:20, 21; Acts 15:15, 16</li>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 10.</span> The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into which Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally resolved.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 2.</span> The same law that was first written in the heart of man continued to be a perfect rule of righteousness after the fall,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> and was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in ten commandments, and written in two tables, the four first containing our duty towards God, and the other six, our duty to man.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

The promises of it likewise show them God’s approbation of obedience, and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof, though not as due to them by the law as a covenant of works; so as man’s doing good and refraining from evil, because the law encourages to the one and deters from the other, is no evidence of his being under the law and not under grace.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 1.</span> The light of nature shows that there is a God, who has lordship and sovereignty over all; is just, good and does good to all; and is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and served, with all the heart and all the soul, and with all the might.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God, is instituted by himself,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and so limited by his own revealed will, that he may not be worshipped according to the imagination and devices of men, nor the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representations, or any other way not prescribed in the Holy Scriptures.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 2.</span> Religious worship is to be given to God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and to him alone;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> not to angels, saints, or any other creatures;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> and since the fall, not without a mediator,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> nor in the mediation of any other but Christ alone.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 3.</span> Prayer, with thanksgiving, being one part of natural worship, is by God required of all men.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> But that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> by the help of the Spirit,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> according to his will;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance; and when with others, in a known tongue.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 6.</span> Neither prayer nor any other part of religious worship, is now under the gospel, tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed; but God is to be worshipped everywhere in spirit and in truth;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> as in private families<sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> daily,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> and in secret each one by himself;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> so more solemnly in the public assemblies, which are not carelessly nor wilfully to be neglected or forsaken, when God by his word or providence calls thereunto.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 7.</span> As it is the law of nature, that in general a proportion of time, by God’s appointment, be set apart for the worship of God, so by his Word, in a positive moral, and perpetual commandment, binding all men, in all ages, he has particularly appointed one day in seven for a sabbath to be kept holy unto him,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> which from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ was the last day of the week, and from the resurrection of Christ was changed into the first day of the week, which is called the Lord’s Day:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> and is to be continued to the end of the world as the Christian Sabbath, the observation of the last day of the week being abolished.

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">OF LAWFUL OATHS AND VOWS</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 1.</span> A lawful oath is a part of religious worship, wherein the person swearing in truth, righteousness, and judgment, solemnly calls God to witness what he swears,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and to judge him according to the truth or falseness thereof.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 2.</span> The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear; and therein it is to be used, with all holy fear and reverence; therefore to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious and dreadful name, or to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> yet as in matter of weight and moment, for confirmation of truth, and ending all strife, an oath is warranted by the word of God;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> so a lawful oath being imposed by lawful authority in such matters, ought to be taken.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 3.</span> Whosoever takes an oath warranted by the word of God, ought duly to consider the weightiness of so solemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he knows to be truth; for that by rash, false, and vain oaths, the Lord is provoked, and for them this land mourns.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

	<li id="7">Ps. 24:4</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 5.</span> A vow, which is not to be made to any creature, but to God alone, is to be made and performed with all religious care and faithfulness;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> but popish monastical vows of perpetual single life,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> professed poverty,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> and regular obedience, are so far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are superstitious and sinful snares, in which no Christian may entangle himself.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 2.</span> It is lawful for Christians to accept and execute the office of a magistrate when called thereunto; in the management whereof, as they ought especially to maintain justice and peace,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> according to the wholesome laws of each kingdom and commonwealth, so for that end they may lawfully now, under the New Testament, wage war upon just and necessary occasions.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">OF THE LORD’S SUPPER</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 1.</span> The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and showing to all the world the sacrifice of himself in his death,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> confirmation of the faith of believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment, and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all duties which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

	<li id="1">1 Cor. 11:23-26</li>
	<li id="2">1 Cor. 10:16,17,21</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 2.</span> In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the quick or dead, but only a memorial of that one offering up of himself by himself upon the cross, once for all;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> So that the popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it, is most abominable, injurious to Christ’s own sacrifice the alone propitiation for all the sins of the elect.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 3.</span> The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his ministers to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to a holy use, and to take and break the bread; to take the cup, and, they communicating also themselves, to give both to the communicants.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

	<li id="5">1 Cor. 11:23-26, etc.</li>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 4.</span> The denial of the cup to the people, worshipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and reserving them for any pretended religious use, are all contrary to the nature of this ordinance, and to the institution of Christ.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<ol start="6">
	<li id="6">Matt. 26:26-28, 15:9, Exod. 20:4,5</li>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 5.</span> The outward elements in this ordinance, duly set apart to the use ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that truly, although in terms used figuratively, they are sometimes called by the names of the things they represent, in other words, the body and blood of Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were before.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup>

	<li id="8">1 Cor. 11:26-28</li>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 6.</span> That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of Christ’s body and blood, commonly called transubstantiation, by consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant not to Scripture alone,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> but even to common sense and reason, overthrows the nature of the ordinance, and has been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions, yea, of gross idolatries.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 7.</span> Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements in this ordinance, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death; the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup>

<ol start="11">
	<li id="11">1 Cor. 10:16, 11:23-26</li>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 8.</span> All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Christ, so are they unworthy of the Lord’s table, and cannot, without great sin against him, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries, or be admitted thereunto;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> yea, whosoever shall receive unworthily, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, eating and drinking judgment to themselves.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 1.</span> The bodies of men after death return to dust, and see corruption;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> The souls of the righteous being then made perfect in holiness, are received into paradise, where they are with Christ, and behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and the souls of the wicked are cast into hell; where they remain in torment and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> besides these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledgeth none.

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">OF THE LAST JUDGMENT</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 1.</span> God has appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteousness, by Jesus Christ;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father; in which day, not only the apostate angels shall be judged,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> but likewise all persons that have lived upon the earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 2.</span> The end of God’s appointing this day, is for the manifestation of the glory of his mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect; and of his justice, in the eternal damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> for then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fulness of joy and glory with everlasting rewards, in the presence of the Lord; but the wicked, who do not know God, and do not obey the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast aside into everlasting torments,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> and punished with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>
