I've been slandered before in my life (Pr 10:18), but I rest in the fact that I know that their time is coming (Ps 101:5 ESV), and it brings a smile to my face to know that I do not laugh alone (Ps 37:13; Pr 1:26 ESV). <!--Ps 59:8-->

> "With their words, the godless destroy their friends, but knowledge will rescue the righteous." &mdash; Pr 11:9 NLT

Because God has preserved me (1Jn 5:18; Mt 24:13 ESV; 2Tim 4:7 ESV; Ro 2:7 NET) and I have endured persecution, I will receive the crown of life (James 1:12), while my slanderers... well, lets just say there's not a lot of AC where they are going.

> But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. &mdash; Matthew 5:22

<!-- I see them for what they are, [&ldquo;false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. &rdquo;](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/) God has revealed them to me, [&ldquo;You will recognize them by their fruits.&rdquo;](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/). -->

I see them for what they are now, [&ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits.&rdquo;](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/) God has revealed them to me. 

<!-- > These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because they do not have God’s Spirit in them. &mdash; Jude 1:19 NLT -->

> For you are the children of your father the devil, and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from the beginning. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">He has always hated the truth, because there is no truth in him.</span> When he lies, it is consistent with his character; for he is a liar and the father of lies. &mdash; John 8:44 NLT

It is time to return to the old ways and ancient paths of protestantism for the truth. Perhaps even older (Χριστιανισμός). Followers of “The Way” (ἡ ὁδός - hė hodós).

> Thus says the Lord:<br>
“Stand by the roads, and look,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and ask for the ancient paths,<br>
where the good way is; and walk in it,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and find rest for your souls.<br>
But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’ 
>
&mdash; Jeremiah 6:16 ESV (cf. Deut 32:7)

If you are one of my persecutors, and you feel remorse for what you have said or done, I would ask that you repent (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4; Lk 13:3) away from the practice of sinning (1Jn 3:6-10), because the Bible is clear that if you hate other believers and live unrighteously (1Jn 2:9; 3:10; 4:20) that you do not belong to God, and that is a really bad position to be in. We're justified by faith (Rom 3:28), but clearly if you meet the above criteria, your faith is dead (James 2:17,26) and superficial (2 Cor. 13:5).

<!-- Further, if you are the kind of persecutor that likes to project or mislabel me as hateful or judgemental simply because I hold true Christian beliefs, I would ask you to reconsider, because I know for a fact that I have never attacked or maligned the only reason you are (Jd 1:19) -->

If you are unrepentant (Lk 13:3), divisive (Jd 1:19), and you practice and pursue lifestyles of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Gal 5:19-21), you literally have no assurance of salvation. The likelihood that you will enter the kingdom of heaven is zero, no matter how blind your faith is.

 This is the wake up call that will save your life. You should be told to test to see if your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), to see if you really are trusting in Christ, because if you were, you'd be repentant, you'd carry your cross daily (Mt 10:38; Lk 9:23), you'd be bearing the fruits of obedience (John 15:1-17; James 2:14-26; Jn 14:15; 1 Jn 2:4), and you'd have the assurance of being foreknown (Mt 22:14). These are divine enablements.

<!-- One of the biggest signs of progress, is the accumulation of those who would hate you for trying. I've come to the realization, that the envious hate dreamers, because their dreams were never realized. Instead of taking offense at such insults, you should remind yourself that you're making true progress, and that this is simply the natural response of those who would project their own insecurities and limitations upon you. Move beyond their limits by doubling down on your efforts at success. Use the following methods & realizations to create a healthy environment for your mind. -->

<!-- > “The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.” &mdash; Epictetus -->

<!-- Epictetus reminds us that sometimes the most appropriate response is simply to laugh to oneself. A provocateur cannot truly know who you are can they?  -->

<!-- > “I laugh at those who think they can damage me. They do not know who I am, they do not know what I think, they cannot even touch the things which are really mine and with which I live.” &mdash; Epictetus -->

<!-- Remember that if we do not entertain provocations they cannot cause us discomfort. -->

<!-- > “We suffer more often in imagination than in reality” &mdash; Lucius Annaeus Seneca -->

<!-- > “**Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things.** Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and of one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others or himself.” &mdash;  Epictetus, The Enchiridion of Epictetus -->


<!-- # The Philosophical Taoist Method

In some Chinese translations of the New Testament, λόγος (logos) is translated with the Chinese word dao (道) (e.g. John 1:1-3,14), indicating that the translators considered the concept of Tao to be somewhat equivalent to logos in Greek philosophy and the Logos (The Word/Jesus) in Christianity.<sup>[source](https://books.google.com/books?id=M9YkDwAAQBAJ)</sup>

Sinicizing Christianity, Zheng (2017), p. 187

In the thinking of noted christian author C.S. Lewis, God created the Tao and fully displayed it through the person of Jesus Christ. 

A sinicized view of the logos is acceptable

Noted Christian author C.S. Lewis used the word Tao to describe: -->

<!-- > "the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, the kind of thing the Universe is and the kind of things we are." &mdash; Lewis, C.S. The Abolition of Man. p. 18. -->

<!-- He asserted that every religion and philosophy contains foundations of universal ethics as an attempt to line up with the Tao—the way mankind was designed to be. In Lewis' thinking, God created the Tao and fully displayed it through the person of Jesus Christ. -->

<!-- The best translation of the Tao Te Ching is by far the one translated by [Gia-Fu Feng](https://eheart.com/TAO/TTC/TTCchapters-small.pdf).

<!-- ## **Wise Words From The Book Theaetetus** -->

<!-- > "Only I beg that you will observe this condition: do not be unjust in your questions. It is the height of unreasonableness that a person who professes to care for moral goodness should
be consistently unjust in discussion. I mean by injustice, in this connection,
the behavior of a man who does not take care to keep controversy distinct
from discussion; a man who forgets that in controversy he may play about
and trip up his opponent as often as he can, but that **in discussion he must be serious, he must keep on helping his opponent to his feet again, and point out to him only those of his slips which are due to himself or to the intellectual society which he has previously frequented**. If you observe this distinction, those who associate with you will blame themselves for their confusion and their difficulties, not you. They will seek your company,
and think of you as their friend; but they will loathe themselves, and seek
refuge from themselves in philosophy, in the hope that they may thereby
become different people and be rid forever of the men that they once were.
But if you follow the common practice and do the opposite, you will get the opposite results. Instead of philosophers, you will make your companions grow up to be the enemies of philosophy.
>
‘So, if you take my advice, as I said before, you will sit down with us
without ill will or hostility, in a kindly spirit. You will genuinely try to
find out what our meaning is when we maintain that all things are in
motion and that for each person and each city, things are what they seem
to them to be. And upon this basis you will inquire whether knowledge and
perception are the same thing or different things. But you will not proceed
as you did just now. You will not base your argument upon the use and
wont of language; you will not follow the practice of most men, who drag words this way and that at their pleasure, so making every imaginable
difficulty for one another.'" &mdash; Socrates (Plato) -->
