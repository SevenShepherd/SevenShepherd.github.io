An admonition to false teachers who slander, project, and divide families.

> <sup>1</sup> Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.
>
> <sup>2</sup> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.
>
> &mdash; Jeremiah 23:1-2 KJV

There are several places in the Bible that teach us how to spot false teachers who have infiltrated the Church. 

**(1)** In Matthew 7:15-20 we find that we can recognize or identify them by their fruits, that is by their behavior and deeds. Watch what they say and do, do they project hatred and hostility onto those who correct them in love? Do they deviate from the sound doctrines of the founders of their church or protestantism as a whole?

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> ‚ÄúBeware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way they act.</span> Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> A good tree can‚Äôt produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can‚Äôt produce good fruit. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> So <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:YellowGreen;">every tree</span> that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:YellowGreen;">people</span> by their actions.</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:15-20 NLT

**(2)** Another way we can spot false teachers is by observing what they teach. Do they teach antinomian heresies and tell their congregation that it's ok to practice or pursue lifestyles of sin? Are they teaching debauched lifestyles and abusing grace as a license to sin (Jd 4 NET; 1Jn 3:6-10)?

‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer: Everyone sins (1 Jn 1:8‚Äì10), but not everyone pursues lifestyles of indulgent sin (1Jn 3:6-10). Though we may stumble, make mistakes, and God forbid backslide, there is no such thing as a born again Christian that &ldquo;*practices*&rdquo; sin (habitually and continually pursuing a lifestyle of sin).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But false prophets arose among the people, just as <span style="font-weight:bold;">there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">even to the point of denying the <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Master</span> who bought them</span>. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">many will follow their <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">debauched lifestyles</span></span>. Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. &mdash; [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET)
>> Second Pet 2:1 describes ‚Äúfalse prophets‚Äù who ‚Äúsecretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Sovereign Lord who bought them.‚Äù These persons professed to be Christians and were influential teachers of the church. **Peter‚Äôs elaboration of them as ‚Äúbrute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed‚Äù (v. 12), ‚Äúsprings without water and mists driven by a storm‚Äù (v. 17), and ‚Äúslaves of depravity‚Äù (v. 19) shows that the subjects were unregenerate professors of the faith.** The end of their apostasy is described as ‚Äúswift destruction‚Äù (cf. v. 12b, 17b). &mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest (Ph.D., University of Manchester), The Cross and Salvation, Chapter Eleven, III. Exposition of the Doctrine of Preservation,  D. Some Apostatize Because Unconverted. p. 457.

Christians do not "practice" sin, abuse grace as a license to sin, or remain in a lifestyle of sin (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62).

<a name="children-of-the-devil" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2. Exposing The Children Of The Devil</a>

The children of the devil will depart from sound doctrine, betray you for false teachers and for many other reasons, hate their own family & friends, and be devoid of love.

> <sup>10</sup> And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other. <sup>11</sup> And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people. <sup>12</sup> Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold. <sup>13</sup> But the one who endures to the end will be saved. &mdash; Matthew 24:10-13 NLT

The children of the devil will seek out teachers that tell them what they want to hear, they need the confirmation bias that allows them to continue on in their debauched lifestyles.

> <sup>3</sup> For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching. They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear. <sup>4</sup> They will reject the truth and chase after myths. &mdash; 2 Timothy 4:3-4 NLT

They will do anything to keep their lifestyles of sin practice to the point of betraying, slandering, mislabeling and lying on those who bring the truth of repentance and fruit bearing.. even to their own blood.

> For you are the children of your father the devil, and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from the beginning. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">He has always hated the truth, because there is no truth in him.</span> When he lies, it is consistent with his character; for he is a liar and the father of lies. &mdash; John 8:44 NLT

The children of the devil are divisive, they hate their Calvinist, Arminian, Amyraldian, Reformed Arminian, brothers and sisters. They can't seem to be happy that we're all protestants and we all maintain essential doctrine. 

> These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because they do not have God‚Äôs Spirit in them. &mdash; Jude 1:19 NLT

The Bible is clear that if you hate other believers and live unrighteously that you do not belong to God, in fact, the Apostle John calls people like this, children of the devil, and I'm inclined to agree.

> So now <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">we can tell</span> who are children of God and who are <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">children of the devil</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Anyone</span> who does not live righteously [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%203%3A10&version=MOUNCE" style="font-style:italic;color:#A8A8A8;">dikaiosynƒì</a>] and does not love [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%203%3A10&version=MOUNCE" style="font-style:italic;color:#A8A8A8;">agapa≈ç</a>] other believers <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">does not belong to God</span>. &mdash; 1 John 3:10 NLT

Love was taught from the very beginning (1Jn 3:11). 

> Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. &mdash; 1 John 3:15 ESV

> If someone says, ‚ÄúI love God,‚Äù but hates a fellow believer, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:FireBrick;">that person is a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">liar</span></span>; for if we don‚Äôt love people we can see, how can we love God, whom we cannot see? &mdash; 1 John 4:20 NLT

> If anyone claims, ‚ÄúI am living in the light,‚Äù but hates a fellow believer, that person is still living in darkness. &mdash; 1 John 2:9 NLT

True believers will always be marked by the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal 5:22-23) and the children of the devil will evidently pursue the works of the flesh (Gal 5:19-21).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">anyone living that sort of life <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">will not</span> inherit the Kingdom of God.</span>
>
><sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">the Holy Spirit produces this kind of <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:YellowGreen;">fruit</span> in our lives</span>: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!
>
>&mdash; Galatians 5:19-23 NLT

<a name="synagogs-of-satan" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3. The Synagogs of Satan</a>

<!-- In these verses, the term is used metaphorically to refer to those who claim to be Jews (i.e., God's people) but are not truly following God. It is likely that these references were directed at specific groups or individuals in the churches at that time who were opposing or misleading the believers. The phrase is not meant to condemn all Jewish people but rather to address a specific group or attitude within the context of the early Christian church. -->

These verses can serve as a reminder to discern carefully the teachings and practices of those who claim to be part of the Christian faith. Just as there were false teachers in the early church, there may be individuals or groups today who claim to be Christian but do not truly follow Christ.

> ‚ÄúI know about your suffering and your poverty‚Äîbut you are rich! I know the blasphemy of those opposing you. They say they are Jews, but they are not, because their synagogue belongs to Satan. &mdash; Revelation 2:9 NLT

<!-- > Look, I will force those who belong to Satan‚Äôs synagogue‚Äîthose liars who say they are Jews but are not‚Äîto come and bow down at your feet. They will acknowledge that you are the ones I love. &mdash; Revelation 3:9 NLT -->

If they continue to oppose the truth God will show them their place.

> Behold, I will make those of the **synagogue of Satan** who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie‚Äîbehold, **I will make them come and bow down before your feet**, and they will learn that I have loved you. &mdash; Revelation 3:9 NLT

I've been slandered before in my life (Pr 10:18), but I rest in the fact that I know that their time is coming (Ps 101:5 ESV), and it brings a smile to my face to know that I do not laugh alone (Ps 37:13; Pr 1:26 ESV; Ps 59:8).

Because God has preserved me (1Jn 5:18; Mt 24:13 ESV; 2Tim 4:7 ESV; Ro 2:7 NET) and I have endured persecution, I will receive the crown of life (James 1:12), while my slanderers... to graphic to describe their future if they do not repent.

It is time to return to the old ways and ancient paths of protestantism for the truth. Perhaps even older (ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ). Followers of ‚ÄúThe Way‚Äù (·º° ·ΩÅŒ¥œåœÇ - hƒó hod√≥s).

‚ÄúStand by the roads, and look,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and ask for the ancient paths,<br>
where the good way is; and walk in it,<br>
<span style="margin-left:2em;"></span>and find rest for your souls.<br>

&mdash; Jeremiah 6:16 ESV (cf. Deut 32:7)

If you are one of my persecutors, and you feel remorse for what you have said or done, I would ask that you repent (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4; Lk 13:3) away from the practice of sinning (1Jn 3:6-10), because the Bible is clear that if you hate other believers and live unrighteously (1Jn 2:9; 3:10; 4:20) that you do not belong to God, and that is a really bad position to be in. We're justified by faith (Rom 3:28), but clearly if you meet the above criteria, your faith is dead (James 2:17,26) and superficial (2 Cor. 13:5).

> There are six things which Yahweh hates, Even seven **which are an abomination to Him**: Haughty eyes, **a lying tongue**, And hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked thoughts, Feet that hasten to run to evil, **A false witness who breathes out lies, <span style="color:FireBrick;">And one who spreads strife among brothers</span>.** &mdash; Proverbs 6:16-19

<!-- If you are unrepentant (Lk 13:3), divisive (Jd 1:19), and you practice and pursue lifestyles of sin (1Jn 3:6-10; Gal 5:19-21), you literally have no assurance of salvation. The likelihood that you will enter the kingdom of heaven is zero, no matter how blind your faith is. -->

<!-- This is the wake up call that will save your life. You should be told to test to see if your faith is genuine (2Cor.13:5), to see if you really are trusting in Christ, because if you were, you'd be repentant, you'd carry your cross daily (Mt 10:38; Lk 9:23), you'd be bearing the fruits of obedience (John 15:1-17; James 2:14-26; Jn 14:15; 1 Jn 2:4), and you'd have the assurance of being foreknown (Mt 22:14).

# The Stoic Method

<!-- Stoicism is an good way to handle the vicissitudes of life. Remaining equanimous in the face of evil is a skill known only to silver men. -->

<!-- > ‚ÄúThe key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.‚Äù &mdash; Epictetus -->

<!-- Epictetus reminds us that sometimes the most appropriate response is simply to laugh to oneself. A provocateur cannot truly know who you are can they?  -->

<!-- > ‚ÄúI laugh at those who think they can damage me. They do not know who I am, they do not know what I think, they cannot even touch the things which are really mine and with which I live.‚Äù &mdash; Epictetus -->

<!-- Remember that if we do not entertain provocations they cannot cause us discomfort. -->

<!-- > ‚ÄúWe suffer more often in imagination than in reality‚Äù &mdash; Lucius Annaeus Seneca -->

<!-- > ‚Äú**Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things.** Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and of one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others or himself.‚Äù &mdash;  Epictetus, The Enchiridion of Epictetus -->


<!-- # The Philosophical Taoist Method

In some Chinese translations of the New Testament, ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ (logos) is translated with the Chinese word dao (ÈÅì) (e.g. John 1:1-3,14), indicating that the translators considered the concept of Tao to be somewhat equivalent to logos in Greek philosophy and the Logos (The Word/Jesus) in Christianity.<sup>[source](https://books.google.com/books?id=M9YkDwAAQBAJ)</sup>

Sinicizing Christianity, Zheng (2017), p. 187

In the thinking of noted christian author C.S. Lewis, God created the Tao and fully displayed it through the person of Jesus Christ. 

A sinicized view of the logos is acceptable

Noted Christian author C.S. Lewis used the word Tao to describe: -->

<!-- > "the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, the kind of thing the Universe is and the kind of things we are." &mdash; Lewis, C.S. The Abolition of Man. p. 18. -->

<!-- He asserted that every religion and philosophy contains foundations of universal ethics as an attempt to line up with the Tao‚Äîthe way mankind was designed to be. In Lewis' thinking, God created the Tao and fully displayed it through the person of Jesus Christ. -->

<!-- The best translation of the Tao Te Ching is by far the one translated by [Gia-Fu Feng](https://eheart.com/TAO/TTC/TTCchapters-small.pdf).

> Yield and overcome;<br>
Bend and be straight;<br>
Empty and be full;<br>
Wear out and be new;<br>
Have little and gain;<br>
Have much and be confused.<br>
>
Therefore the wise embrace the one<br>
And set an example to all.<br>
Not putting on a display,<br>
They shine forth.<br>
Not justifying themselves,<br>
They are distinguished.<br>
Not boasting,<br>
They receive recognition.<br>
Not bragging,<br>
They never falter.<br>
**They do not quarrel,**<br>
**So no one quarrels with them.**<br>
Therefore the ancients say, ‚ÄúYield and overcome.‚Äù<br>
Is that an empty saying?<br>
Be truly whole,<br>
And all things will come to you.<br>
>
&mdash; Tao Te Ching, Twenty Two

<!-- > Ninth. Kindness is invincible - if it is sincere, not fawning or 9 -->
<!-- pretence. What can the most aggressive man do to you if you
continue to be kind to him? If, as opportunity arises, you gently
admonish him and take your time to re-educate him at the very
moment when he is trying to do you harm? 'No, son, we were
born for other purposes than this. There is no way that I can
be harmed, but you are harming yourself, son.' And show him
delicately how things are, making the general point that bees
do not act like this, or any other creatures of gregarious nature.
But your advice must not be ironic or critical. It should be
affectionate, with no hurt feelings, not a lecture or a demonstration to impress others, but the way you would talk to
someone by himself irrespective of company. -->


<!-- ## **Wise Words From The Book Theaetetus** -->

<!-- > "Only I beg that you will observe this condition: do not be unjust in your questions. It is the height of unreasonableness that a person who professes to care for moral goodness should
be consistently unjust in discussion. I mean by injustice, in this connection,
the behavior of a man who does not take care to keep controversy distinct
from discussion; a man who forgets that in controversy he may play about
and trip up his opponent as often as he can, but that **in discussion he must be serious, he must keep on helping his opponent to his feet again, and point out to him only those of his slips which are due to himself or to the intellectual society which he has previously frequented**. If you observe this distinction, those who associate with you will blame themselves for their confusion and their difficulties, not you. They will seek your company,
and think of you as their friend; but they will loathe themselves, and seek
refuge from themselves in philosophy, in the hope that they may thereby
become different people and be rid forever of the men that they once were.
But if you follow the common practice and do the opposite, you will get the opposite results. Instead of philosophers, you will make your companions grow up to be the enemies of philosophy.
>
‚ÄòSo, if you take my advice, as I said before, you will sit down with us
without ill will or hostility, in a kindly spirit. You will genuinely try to
find out what our meaning is when we maintain that all things are in
motion and that for each person and each city, things are what they seem
to them to be. And upon this basis you will inquire whether knowledge and
perception are the same thing or different things. But you will not proceed
as you did just now. You will not base your argument upon the use and
wont of language; you will not follow the practice of most men, who drag words this way and that at their pleasure, so making every imaginable
difficulty for one another.'" &mdash; Socrates (Plato) -->
