**E. Unconditional Single Election
(Moderately Reformed)**
>
Some claim that the doctrine of sovereign election to life was an
Augustinian invention. Most pre-Augustinian Fathers failed to articulate
a clear-cut doctrine of election for at least two reasons. **(1)** Many early
Christian authorities reacted against rigorous Stoic and Gnostic fatalism
and determinism by stressing human freedom and responsibility. From
Justin Martyr (d. 165) onwards many early church authorities stated that
election is conditioned on foreseen free human responses to the Gospel.
Salvation, according to these Fathers, was a synergistic cooperation
between the sinner and God’s Spirit. Thus Brunner astutely observed:
>
>> In a world . . . dominated by the idea of Fate, it was far more important to stress the freedom and responsibility of man than the fact
that he is determined. This concern led the Early Church Fathers to
the other extreme of Free Will, which they developed in connexion
with the Stoic idea of autexousion as the presupposition of moral
responsibility.<sup>64</sup>
>
In addition, **(2)** many early Fathers succumbed to the prevailing spirit
of Hellenistic naturalism. As Thomas F. Torrance noted, “The converts of
the first few generations had great difficulty in apprehending the distinctive aspects of the gospel, as for example, the doctrine of grace. It was so astonishingly new to the natural man.”<sup>65</sup> Torrance’s studies identified “the urge toward self-justification in the second century fathers.”<sup>66</sup> Under the influence of Greek humanism, many early Christian writers judged that God gives saving grace to those who worthily strive after righteousness.
These insights help us to understand why prior to Augustine the doctrines
of sovereign grace and election were muted.
>
Nevertheless, belief in human depravity and greater commitment to the
divine initiative in salvation gradually developed in the Christian community. Tertullian (d. 220) noted that, contrary to those born in a pagan
home, “the children of believers were in some sense destined for holiness
and salvation.”<sup>67</sup> Athanasius (d. 373) on occasion spoke the language of
unconditional divine election. Commenting on Eph 1:3-5 and 2 Tim 1:8­
10, he observed that whereas the Fall was “foreseen” the salvation of some
people was predestined or “prepared beforehand.”<sup>68</sup> In the same vein
Ambrose (d. 397), whose preaching greatly influenced Augustine, wrote
as follows: “God calls those whom he deigns to call; he makes him pious
whom he wills to make pious, for if he had willed he could have changed
the impious into pious.”69
>
Augustine’s (d. 430) early position on election, set forth in his exposition of Romans, was synergistic: God predestined those he foreknew
would exercise faith in Christ. Yet wrestling with Scripture in the course
of refuting the Pelagian heresy, Augustine changed his view and described
the synergism he formerly held as the “pest of the Pelagian error.”
According to Brunner, “Augustine was the only great teacher of the Early
Church who gave reliable Biblical teaching on the subject of Sin and
Grace.”<sup>70</sup> The bishop insisted that although the unregenerate possess considerable psychological freedom, they lack the moral freedom (i.e., the
power) to do the good. In particular, sinners cannot take the first step
toward God unless enabled by God’s Spirit. Wrote the bishop, “The
human will does not attain grace through freedom, but rather freedom
through grace.”<sup>71</sup> In other words, the divine commands will be fulfilled
only as God himself gives the ability to perform them. Thus his prayer to
God was, “Give what you command, and command what you will.”72
>
Augustine believed that by virtue of original sin all persons justly
deserve judgment. But if God through unmerited mercy should choose to
save some sinners and not others, none could charge him with acting
unrighteously. Thus the bishop understood the Bible to teach that according to his good pleasure and apart from any human merit God in eternity
past sovereignly chose out of the “mass of perdition” a certain number of
sinners to be saved. “Grace came into the world that those who were predestined before the world may be chosen out of the world.”<sup>73</sup> On this
showing God gives to some more than they deserve, but no one gets less
than they deserve. Why God chose to bless some sinners and willed to leave others in their sins has not been revealed. Yet God’s elective purpose
richly displays his mercy and justice. So the bishop reasoned,
>
>> a merciful God delivers so many to the praise of the glory of his
grace from deserved perdition. If He should deliver no one therefrom, he would not be unrighteous. Let him who is delivered love
His grace. Let him who is not delivered acknowledge his due. In
remitting a debt, goodness is perceived; in requiting it, justice.
Unrighteousness is never found with God.74
>
Augustine believed that predestination is sometimes signified under the
name of foreknowledge. “The ordering of his future works in His foreknowledge, which cannot be deceived and changed, is absolute, and is
nothing but predestination.”<sup>75</sup> Depraved sinners’ inability morally and
spiritually rules out the equation of divine foreknowledge with mere prescience. “Had God chosen us on the ground that he foreknew that we
should be good, then would he also have foreknown that we would not
be the first to make choice of him.”<sup>76</sup> Moreover, if God chose sinners
because he foresaw that they would respond to Christ (a form of human
merit), grace would cease to be grace. Such persons would have ground
for boasting. “For it is not by grace if merit preceded: but it is of grace;
and therefore that grace did not find, but effected the merit.”<sup>77</sup> Finally, the bishop held that God did not foreordain persons to damnation in the same
effectual way he foreordained to life. Rather, reprobation represents God’s
determination that the finally impenitent will suffer the just consequences
of their sins. Whereas election to life is unconditional, reprobation to
perdition is conditioned on human disobedience. Thus Augustine understood predestination in an infralapsarian sense.
>
Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) revived Augustine’s doctrines of sin, grace,
and predestination. Considering predestination an aspect of divine providence, Thomas noted that God achieves some of his purposes by direct
“operation” and others by “precept,” “prohibition,” and “permission.”78
He judged that God positively decreed the salvation of some persons,
whereas he permissively decreed the perdition of others. Thomas wrote,
“Some men are directed by divine working to their ultimate end as aided
by grace, while others who are deprived of the same help of grace fall short
of their ultimate end, and since all things that are done by God are foreseen and ordered from eternity by his wisdom . . . the aforementioned differentiation of men must be ordered by God from eternity.”<sup>79</sup> Thomas rejected the view of certain Fathers and medieval authorities that foreknowledge of human merit or virtue is the cause of predestination to life.
“The reason for the predestination of some . . . must be sought in the goodness of God” and not on “the use of grace foreknown by God.”<sup>80</sup> Thomas likewise insisted that predestination does not destroy free will, human
effort, or prayer, for God has chosen to accomplish his purposes by these
secondary causes. “The salvation of a person is predestined by God in such
a way, that whatever helps that person towards salvation falls under the
order of predestination; whether it be one’s own prayers . . . or other good
works, and suchlike, without which one would not attain to salvation.”81
As noted, reprobation is God’s permissive decision to allow sinners to persist in sin and to be punished for it. Thomas plainly wrote, “as predestination includes the will to confer grace and glory, so also reprobation includes the will to permit a person to fall into sin and to impose the punishment of damnation on account of that sin.”82
>
The Belgic Confession (1561) of the Reformed churches in the low countries, states that God is “merciful and just: merciful, since he delivers and
preserves from this perdition all whom he in his eternal and unchangeable
counsel of mere goodness has elected in Christ Jesus our Lord, without any
respect to their works; just, in leaving others in the fall and perdition
wherein they have involved themselves” (art. XVI). Similar is the French
Confession of Faith (1559): “From this corruption and general condemnation in which all men are plunged God, according to his eternal and
immutable council, calleth those whom he hath chosen by his goodness and
mercy alone in our Lord Jesus Christ, without consideration of their
works, to display in them the riches of his mercy; leaving the rest in this
same corruption and condemnation to show in them his justice” (art. XII).
>
The Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England (1571) likewise
opposed the conditional view of election. “Predestination to Life is the
eternal purpose of God, whereby (before the foundations of the world
were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver
from curse and damnation those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of
mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels
made to honour. Wherefore, they which be endued with so excellent benefit of God, be called according to God’s purpose by his Spirit working in
due season” (art. XVII). This article adds, “the godly consideration of predestination and our election in Christ is full of sweet, pleasant, and
unspeakable comfort to godly persons.”
>
The Westminster Confession of Faith (1647) presents the mature
Reformed view on election. “Those of mankind that are predestined unto
life, God, before the foundation of the world was laid, according to his
eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure
of his will, hath chosen in Christ, unto everlasting glory, out of his mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions, or causes moving him thereunto; and all to the praise of his glorious grace” (ch. 3.5).
>
John Gill (d. 1771), an English Baptist, believed that many Scriptures
(e.g., Eph 1:4; 2 Thess 2:13; 2 Tim 1:9) plainly teach God’s unconditional
election to salvation. “This eternal election of particular persons to salvation is absolute, unconditional, and irrespective of faith, holiness, good works, and perseverance as the moving causes or conditions of it; all
which are the fruits and effects of electing grace, but not causes or conditions of it; since these are said to be chosen, not because they were holy, but that they should be so.”<sup>83</sup> Gill held that sovereign election is the first link in the golden chain of salvation; forgiveness of sins, redemption, justification, and perseverance all proceed therefrom as fruit from a tree. Gill defined reprobation as God **(1)** passing by some sinners, thus leaving them
in their sins, and **(2)** inflicting on them just punishment for their sins.
>
Charles Haddon Spurgeon (d. 1892), the Baptist pastor of London’s
Metropolitan Tabernacle, explained the doctrine as follows. **(1)** Election
derives from God’s sovereign purpose. Salvation eventuates not because
humans will it in time, but because God willed it eternally. “The whole
scheme of salvation, from the first to the last, hinges and turns on the
absolute will of God.”<sup>84</sup> **(2)** Election is entirely of grace. Guilty sinners
deserve only wrath and punishment. But from eternity past God loved the
elect in consequence of his own gracious purpose, not because of any foreseen merit in them. “It is quite certain that any virtue which there may be
in any man is the result of God’s grace. Now if it be the result of grace it
cannot be the cause of grace.”<sup>85</sup> And **(3)**, election is personal, not corporate. If it be unjust of God to elect a person to life, it would be far more
unjust of him to elect a nation, for the latter represents an aggregate of
individuals. “God chose that Jew, and that Jew, and that Jew. . . . Scripture
continually speaks of God’s people one by one and speaks of them as having been the special objects of election.”86
>
The Baptist theologian A.H. Strong (d. 1921) held that by virtue of universal depravity God must initiate the process of salvation. The fountainhead of God’s initiative is sovereign election, defined as “that eternal act of God, by which in his sovereign pleasure, and on account of no foreseen merit in them, he chooses certain out of the number of sinful men to be the recipients of the special grace of his Spirit, and so to be made voluntary partakers of Christ’s salvation.”<sup>87</sup> The divine election is not based on any activity of sinners, including faith, since depravity ensures that without special grace the unregenerate would bring forth no Godward move­ment. Moreover, God’s foreknowledge connotes not merely to “know in advance,” but more actively to “regard with favor” or “make an object of care.” In key biblical texts the words “know” and “foreknow” possess the same meaning. Strong’s measured conclusion is that “in spite of difficulties we must accept the doctrine of election.”<sup>88</sup>

This position of a single, unconditional election to life is well supported not only by historical considerations but also by the biblical data, as will be explained in the section that follows.

>> For [God] says to Moses, ‘I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I
will have compassion on whom I have compassion.’ It does not, therefore,
depend on man’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.
Romans 9:15–16
>
The verb elect means ‘select, or choose out’. The biblical doctrine of
election is that before creation God selected out of the human race, foreseen
as fallen, those whom he would redeem, bring to faith, justify, and glorify in
and through Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:28–39; Eph. 1:3–14; 2 Thess. 2:13–14; 2
Tim. 1:9–10). This divine choice is an expression of free and sovereign
grace, for it is unconstrained and unconditional, not merited by anything in
those who are its subjects. God owes sinners no mercy of any kind, only
condemnation; so it is a wonder, and matter for endless praise, that he
should choose to save any of us; and doubly so when his choice involved
the giving of his own Son to suffer as sin-bearer for the elect (Rom. 8:32).
>
The doctrine of election, like every truth about God, involves mystery
and sometimes stirs controversy. But in Scripture it is a pastoral doctrine,
brought in to help Christians see how great is the grace that saves them, and
to move them to humility, confidence, joy, praise, faithfulness, and holiness
in response. It is the family secret of the children of God. We do not know
who else he has chosen among those who do not yet believe, nor why it was
his good pleasure to choose us in particular. What we do know is, first, that
had we not been chosen for life we would not be believers now (for only the
elect are brought to faith), and, second, that as elect believers we may rely
on God to finish in us the good work that he started (1 Cor. 1:8–9; Phil. 1:6;
1 Thess. 5:23–24; 2 Tim. 1:12; 4:18). Knowledge of one’s election thus
brings comfort and joy.
>
Peter tells us we should be ‘eager to make [our] calling and election
sure’ (2 Pet. 1:10) – that is, certain to us. Election is known by its fruits.
Paul knew the election of the Thessalonians from their faith, hope, and love,
the inward and outward transformation of their lives that the gospel had
brought about (1 Thess. 1:3–6). The more that the qualities to which Peter
has been exhorting his readers appear in our lives (goodness, knowledge,
self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness, love: 2 Pet. 1:5–
7), the surer of our own election we are entitled to be.
>
The elect are, from one standpoint, the Father’s gift to the Son (John
6:39; 10:29; 17:2, 24). Jesus testifies that he came into this world
specifically to save them (John 6:37–40; 10:14–16, 26–29; 15:16; 17:6–26;
Eph. 5:25–27), and any account of his mission must emphasize this.
>
Reprobation is the name given to God’s eternal decision regarding those
sinners whom he has not chosen for life. His decision is in essence a
decision not to change them, as the elect are destined to be changed, but to
leave them to sin as in their hearts they already want to do, and finally to
judge them as they deserve for what they have done. When in particular
instances God gives them over to their sins (i.e. removes restraints on their
doing the disobedient things they desire), this is itself the beginning of
judgment. It is called ‘hardening’ (Rom. 9:18; 11:25; cf. Ps. 81:12; Rom.
1:24, 26, 28), and it inevitably leads to greater guilt.
>
Reprobation is a biblical reality (Rom. 9:14–24; 1 Pet. 2:8), but not one
that bears directly on Christian behaviour. The reprobates are faceless so far
as Christians are concerned, and it is not for us to try to identify them.
Rather, we should live in light of the certainty that anyone may be saved if
he or she will but repent and put faith in Christ.
>
We should view all persons that we meet as possibly being numbered
among the elect.

> III. The Exposition Of The Doctrine of Election.
>
> **D. Personal Election in the NT:
A Major Theme**
>
Can we find in the teachings of Jesus and the apostles evidence of personal,
unconditional election? In the parable of the workers in the vineyard
(Matt 20:1-16), the Lord taught that God is not obliged to deal with everyone in the same way. To those who objected that they worked all day but
received the same wage as those who worked but one hour, Jesus inferred
that none get less than they deserve (justice), but some get more than they
deserve (grace). It is not unjust of God to give some more than their due. Elsewhere Jesus taught that of old God favored certain persons with his
grace while passing by others. Thus there were many needy widows in
Israel in Elijah’s day, but the prophet was sent to minister only to the
widow of Zarephath (Luke 4:25-26; cf. 1 Kgs 17:8-24). In addition, there
were many lepers in Israel at that time, but only one was healed of the disease, namely, Naaman the Syrian (Luke 4:27; cf. 2 Kgs 5:1-14).
>
Furthermore, Jesus acknowledged the Father’s sovereign right to reveal
or conceal the significance of the Son’s words and works as he pleases. The
Lord prayed in Matt 11:25-26, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned,
and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good
pleasure (eudokia).” Eudokia, explaining God’s concealing and revealing
activity, connotes the good pleasure of God’s sovereign will. “Eudokia
expresses independent volition, sovereign choice, but always with an
implication of benevolence.”<sup>103</sup> Jesus confirmed this by adding, “No one
knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses
[present subjunctive of boulomai, to “will”] to reveal him” (Matt 11:27).
Thus God sovereignly chose to extend his enlightening and saving influence to some persons, while withholding it from others (cf. Matt 13:11).
Although Matt 11:28-30 likely was spoken at another time in Jesus’ ministry, a universal invitation to receive Jesus (v. 28) is not inconsistent with
God’s purpose to reveal himself to some. This is so because **(1)** Christ’s
provision on the cross was universal (see chap. 4). And **(2)** all who
respond positively to the invitation will be saved (John 11:26; Acts 10:43;
Rom 10:11, 13); but tragically for themselves, depraved sinners are unresponsive to spiritual impulses—hence the need for a supernatural initiative (see chap. 5).
>
The adjective eklektos occurs twenty-two times in the NT, seventeen
times (as a plural) in the sense of “chosen” or “elect” saints. Those envisaged are individuals within the remnant of Israel (Matt 24:22, 24, 31;
Mark 13:20, 22, 27; Luke 18:7) and citizens of the church (Rom 8:33; Col
3:12; 2 Tim 2:10; Tit 1:1; 1 Pet 1:1). The elect are viewed not as an empty
class, for in the preceding verses the elect cry out to God, obey Christ, are
faithful to him, and reflect the fruits of the Spirit—all of which are activities of individuals, who also may be considered as a group or a class.
>
Although John affirmed God’s love for the entire world, the Fourth
Gospel, more emphatically than the Synoptics, emphasizes God’s sovereign choice of certain persons to be saved. This is clear in John 5:21,
where Jesus said to the Jews, “just as the Father raises the dead and gives
them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.”
Likewise in John 13:18 Jesus said to his disciples, “I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen.” The Lord chose the Twelve as a
group for ministry, but prior to that he chose each one, save Judas, for
salvation.104
>
Speaking figuratively, Jesus in John 10 identified himself as the shepherd
and his elect people as the “sheep.”<sup>105</sup> John drew several important conclusions concerning the relation between the shepherd and the sheep, as
follows: **(1)** The sheep are those people whom the Father specifically has
given to the Son (v. 29). The fact that God has gifted certain persons to
the Son is reiterated in John 17:2, 6, 9, 24 and 18:9, the frequency of mention suggesting that this was an important concept to John. Jesus taught
more specifically in John 6:37, “All that the Father gives me will come to
me” (i.e., will believe and be saved). Concerning the sheep, the Father
“chose them out of the world for the possession and the service of the
Son.”<sup>106</sup> See also John 15:19, where Christ chose (eklegomai) the disciples out of the world both for salvation and service, a fact taught in similar language in John 17:6, 14, 16. The verb eklegomai (to “choose,”
“select”) is used eight times of Jesus choosing disciples and seven times of
God’s choice of people for eternal life (Mark 13:20; Acts 17:13; 1 Cor 1:27
[two times], 28; Eph 1:4; Jas 2:5). Carson rightly concludes that “They
are Christ’s obedient sheep in his salvific purpose before they are his sheep
in obedient practice.”<sup>107</sup> **(2)** The shepherd died to achieve the salvation of the sheep (vv. 11, 15). Moreover, Jesus reveals himself redemptively to
those the Father gave him out of the world (John 17:6, 8), and for these
he intercedes in heaven. **(3)** The shepherd “knows” his sheep and “calls”
them by name (vv. 3, 14, 27). Just as the oriental shepherd called his sheep
by name, so Jesus the good Shepherd “knows” his sheep personally with
a knowledge that is saving.
>
**(4)** The sheep know the voice of the shepherd and follow him (vv. 4,
27). Jesus said of those not his sheep, “you do not believe because you are
not my sheep” (v. 26). We might have expected Jesus to say, “You are not
my sheep because you do not believe,” but he said precisely the opposite.
A sinner, then, does not become a “sheep” by believing in Jesus; rather, he
or she believes in Jesus because antecedently appointed by God as one of
the “sheep.” **(5)** Jesus’ saying—“I have other sheep that are not of this
sheep pen. I must bring them also” (v. 16)—refers to specific Gentiles who
de jure belonged to Christ by divine election even though de facto they had
not yet come to faith. In the Johannine texts cited, the “sheep” are not an
empty class, for they are said to “hear,” “know,” “believe,” “trust,” “follow,” and “love” the Shepherd—all of which are individual actions before
being considered as actions of a group or a class.
>
The theme of election is not absent from the record of the explosive growth of the church in Acts. At Pisidian Antioch Paul acknowledged God’s corporate election of national Israel for spiritual and temporal blessings (Acts 13:17). Yet at the conclusion of Paul’s and Barnabas’ ministry in that city, Luke stated that “all who were appointed to eternal life believed” (Acts 13:48). The key word is the perfect passive participle of tassō, to “order,” “appoint,” or “ordain.” This verb occurs eight times in the NT, but only here in the sense of appointment to eternal life. F.F. Bruce suggested that the verb might be translated “enrolled” or “inscribed” in the Lamb’s book of life (cf. Luke 10:20; Phil 4:3; Rev 13:8; 17:8).<sup>108</sup> Luke’s words clearly indicate that God’s sovereign action, be it ordaining or enrolling (or both), occurred prior to the person’s believing. The Gentile
hearers believed because appointed to life; they were not appointed
because they believed. All of this speaks the language of God’s sovereign
election of certain persons for salvation.109
>
During his second missionary journey, Paul had a vision in which God
encouraged him to continue preaching in Corinth notwithstanding the
severe opposition he would face. Paul must persevere in sharing the
Gospel, God said, “because I have many people (laos) in this city” (Acts
18:10). The heavenly message confirmed that God had chosen many persons in Corinth to be his own, and Paul’s preaching was the divinely
ordained means to bring these elect to salvation. Paul’s later letters indicate that many in Corinth did come to faith and organize as Christian
communities. Leon Morris comments concerning the “people” in Corinth:
“They had not yet done anything about being saved; many of them had
not even heard the gospel. But they were God’s. Clearly it is he who would
bring them to salvation in due course.”110
>
In Rom 8:28-30 Paul delineated the full circle of salvation, which clinched
his argument concerning Christians’ hope of heavenly glory (vv. 18-27).
>
>> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those
who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For
those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the
likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
brothers. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called,
he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.
>
We observe, first, that the foundation of the Christian’s calling to salvation is God’s prothesis, meaning “purpose,” “resolve,” or “decision”
(Rom 9:11; Eph 1:11; 3:11; 2 Tim 1:9). The believer’s hope of future glory
is grounded not in his own will but in the sovereign, pre-temporal purpose
of God.
>
The first of the aorist verbs in the passage is the word proginōskō, to “foreknow,” “choose beforehand.”<sup>111</sup> With humans as subject the word
means to “know beforehand” (Acts 26:5; 2 Pet 3:17). With God as subject the verb could mean either prescience or foreloving/foreordaining
(Rom 8:29; 11:2; 1 Pet 1:20). The foundational verbs yāda‘ and ginōskō
often mean to “perceive,” “understand,” and “know.” But they also mean
“to set regard upon, to know with particular interest, delight, affection,
and action. (Cf. Gen 18:19; Exod 2:25; Ps 1:6; 144:3; Jer 1:5; Amos 3:2;
Hos 13:5; Matt 7:23; 1 Cor 8:3; Gal 4:9; 2 Tim 2:19; 1 John 3:1).”<sup>112</sup> The
verb ginōskō thus can convey God’s intimate acquaintance with his people, specifically the fact that they are “foreloved” or “chosen.” This latter
sense is evident in the following Pauline sayings: “the man who loves God
is known by God” (1 Cor 8:3); “but now that you know God—or rather
are known by God” (Gal 4:9); and “the Lord knows those that are his”
(2 Tim 2:19).
>
The verb proginōskō in Rom 8:29 and 11:2 contextually could be taken
in either of the two senses, i.e., prescience or foreordination. But given the
strongly relational Hebrew background to the word, the unambiguous
sense of proginōskō in 1 Pet 1:20 (see below) and prognōsis in Acts 2:23
and 1 Pet 1:2 (see below), and the whole tenor of Paul’s theology, the probable meaning of proginōskō with God as subject is to “know intimately”
or “forelove.”<sup>113</sup> F.F. Bruce concurs with this judgment. Concerning Rom
8:29, he wrote, “the words ‘whom he did foreknow’ have the connotation of electing grace which is frequently implied by the verb ‘to know’ in
the Old Testament. When God takes knowledge of his people in this special way, he sets his choice upon them.”<sup>114</sup> To the preceding considerations
we add that the biblical language of foreknowledge is always used of
saints, never of the unsaved. Moreover, what God “foreknows” is the
saints themselves, not any decision or action of theirs. Thus divine election is according to foreknowledge (foreloving), not simply according to
foresight (prescience).
>
Paul continues in the Romans text: “For those God foreknew he also
predestined [proōrisen] to be conformed to the likeness of his Son . . .” (v.
29). The verb proōrizō, to “decide beforehand,” or “predestine,” occurs
six times in the NT in the sense of God’s predetermined plan of salvation,
Christ’s sufferings, or gracious election to life (Rom 8:29-30; 1 Cor 2:7;
Eph 1:5, 11). Those on whom God in eternity past set his affection, he sovereignly chose for life.
>
Return for a moment to the larger picture of the golden chain of salvation presented in Rom 8:29-30. The verbs “foreknew,” “predestined,”
“called,” “justified,” and “glorified” are in the aorist tense, which denotes God’s prior determination marking these future events with certainty.
Moreover the verbs grammatically are in exact sequence; thus if the election
and the calling were exclusively corporate, so also would be the justification and the glorification. But God does not justify an empty class; he justifies individuals within the class who are moved to saving faith in Christ. Similarly, it is individuals who possess the Spirit (v. 23), who “groan inwardly” awaiting the day of glorification (v. 23), who exercise “hope” (v. 24), and who display patience (v. 25). Clearly these are spiritual experiences of individual Christians who, when considered aggregately, constitute the class of believers. Thus the focus of the circle of salvation is both corporate and individual.115
>
Romans 9–11 is an important text for understanding God’s saving purpose for Jews and Gentiles. Paul first recalled Israel’s glorious spiritual heritage: “Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the
covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises”
(Rom 9:4; cf. v. 5). Given these lofty privileges, why are so few Jews saved?
Has God’s purpose for his people failed? To these questions Paul
responded with a firm no! The fact is, he continued, “not all who are
descended from Israel are Israel. Nor because they are his descendants are
they all Abraham’s children” (vv. 6-7). The existence of a believing remnant—a circle of elect ones—within ethnic Israel attests that God’s purpose has not been frustrated, that his promise has not failed.
>
Paul further indicated God chose Isaac over Ishmael (vv. 7-9) and Jacob
over Esau (vv. 10-13) before they were born or had done good or evil “in
order that God’s purpose [prothesis] in election [eklogē, “picking out,”
“election,” “selection”] might stand” (v. 11). To support this argument. Paul quoted from Mal 1:2-3, “Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.”
Cranfield concludes that “loved” and “hated” here denote election and
rejection respectively. <sup>116</sup> Paul’s emphasis clearly is upon God’s sovereign
purpose, not man’s response. God’s election of Isaac and Jacob is individual unto salvation and not merely corporate (Israel and Edom) in respect
of earthly privileges, since in vv. 9-13 each of the children—their birth and
their deeds—is in the foreground.<sup>117</sup> Moreover, in v. 24 Paul stated that
God chose and called not only individuals from among the Jews (such as
Isaac and Jacob) but also individuals from among the Gentiles. A further
factor is the flow of Paul’s argument. He sought to show that in spite of
the unbelief of ethnic Israel God’s saving purpose has not failed, as confirmed by the election of a believing remnant exemplified by Isaac and
Jacob. To say that God’s purpose for Israel remains valid, notwithstanding the unbelief of ethnic Israel in general, because God chose the line of Isaac and Jacob for temporal blessings is merely to restate the historical
problem and to solve nothing.118
>
To this affirmation of God’s sovereign election of a remnant within ethnic Israel, Paul’s critics levied two objections. First, God would be unjust
in his dealings (vv. 14-18). This objection would be of little force if the
issue at hand were merely the choice of ethnic Israel for earthly privileges.
But note that Paul’s response to the objection was an emphatic, “Not at
all!” (v. 14). Although finite beings do not comprehend God’s elective purpose, God reserves the right to exercise mercy upon whom he chooses. So
the apostle appealed to Yahweh’s words to Moses, “I will have mercy on
whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion” (v. 15; cf. v. 18).<sup>119</sup> God is not unjust to give a person more than
he deserves while permitting the unsaved to continue in their chosen path
of sin, any more than it is not unjust of an earthly governor to pardon one
criminal and not another. Concerning the divine election of a remnant Paul
wrote, “It does not, therefore, depend on man’s desire or effort, but on
God’s mercy” (v. 16). The decisive factor concerning who will be saved is
God’s sovereign will, not human volition.
>
The second objection levied was that if God is sovereign in election and
hardening, no one could be judged blameworthy (vv. 19-24). Paul
responded sternly to the arrogant objector: “who are you, O man, to talk
back to God?” (v. 20). Appealing to the OT imagery of the potter and the
clay (Jer 18:2-6), Paul argued that as the potter has the right to mold the
clay as he wills, so God has the sovereign right to bestow more grace on
one of his creatures than on another (v. 21). Paul’s reference to “the
objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory” (v. 23)
clearly depicts his sovereign, pre-temporal election of some for heavenly
destiny.<sup>120</sup> Pinnock has argued in the light of the potter and the clay analogy that God “has a great deal for which to answer.”<sup>121</sup> The crucial issue
is, Must the all-perfect God answer to finite and feeble-minded humans,
or must we mortals bow before and answer to a sovereign, just, and allwise God?
>
In the second section of our extended text, Rom 9:30–10:21, Paul
argued that the fact of sovereign election, as expounded from the OT, does
not eliminate the individual’s responsibility for making the right choice.
Quoting from Joel 2:32, Paul wrote, “Everyone who calls on the name of
the Lord will be saved” (10:13). Personal response to the Gospel message
is necessary if one would be saved. Paul continued that the Gospel has
been published widely and to Jews first. “But not all the Israelites accepted
the good news” (v. 16). Why not? Because they sought righteousness by law-keeping rather than by faith in the crucified and risen Messiah. The
Lord holds unbelieving Israel morally responsible for their unbelief.
>
The third section, Rom 11:1-29, explains God’s purpose for the future
of Israel and the Gentiles. Paul again refuted the notion that God has
rejected Israel: “God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew” (v. 2a).
The objects of God’s foreknowledge are the Jewish people, often disobedient and faithless and without praiseworthy responses on their part. Rom
11:2 thus better fits the conclusion reached above—i.e., that God’s foreknowing is equivalent to his foreloving or foreordaining. The NT frequently cites the very close relationship that exists between God’s loving
and his choosing (Eph 1:4; Col 3:12; 1 Thess 1:4; 2 Thess 2:13). That God
has not forsaken his people is evidenced by the fact that “at the present
time there is a remnant chosen by grace” (v. 5). The existence of an elect
remnant within the chosen nation is the outcome of God’s sovereign and
gracious purpose. God formed the remnant by a personal election within
the corporate election to yield a spiritual seed within the institutional people. We underscore the conclusion of Jewett: “Israel was elect in a double
sense: in an outward and temporal sense, the nation, as a nation, was elect;
in an inward, personal, and eternal sense, a faithful remnant was
elected.”<sup>122</sup> To illustrate this choice of an elect remnant, Paul pointed to
himself (v. 1b) and to 7,000 faithful souls in Elijah’s day who would not
bow before Baal (vv. 2b-4). The nation as a whole failed to obtain spiritual blessing (v. 7), “but the elect (eklogē) did [obtain it],” not by works
but by grace (v. 6). We defer discussion of the salvation of many Gentiles
and eventually “all Israel” (v. 26) to the volumes in this series on the
church and eschatology.
>
The apostle, however, concluded his treatment of God’s sovereign elective purpose for Jews and Gentiles with a hymn of praise (vv. 33-36). God’s
gracious choice of certain Jews and Gentiles to be saved lends itself more
to doxology than to precise rational analysis. The salvation of the remnant
is the result of the “wisdom,” “knowledge,” “judgments,” and “mind” of
the Lord.<sup>123</sup> God’s sovereign purpose of mercy and grace to sinners is so
grand and exalted that the only fitting response on the part of feeble
humans is humble praise and adoration. “For from him and through him
and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever!” (v. 36).
>
In Gal 1:15-16 Paul wrote that “God, who set me apart from birth and
called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me so that I might
preach him among the Gentiles. . . .” Paul made it abundantly clear that
prior to his conversion he hated the church and did his utmost to destroy
it (Gal 1:13, 23; cf. Acts 9:1-2, 13-14; 22:4-5; 26:10; 1 Tim 1:13). Yet he
also affirmed that God in grace took the saving initiative in his rebellious life. Thus the Father was pleased to separate him from birth—the word
aphorisas (“separated”) being related to proōrisas (“predestinate”)—and
to reveal his Son to him (cf. 2 Cor 4:6). Only then did the Lord commission Paul for Gospel ministry. The apostle thus attested God’s act of separation in eternity past for salvation and in time for service. As he testified
in Gal 2:20, God’s saving action toward him was profoundly personal.
Thus Paul saw himself **(1)** personally loved by Christ (“who loved me”),
**(2)** personally justified (“I live by faith in the Son of God”), **(3)** personally
regenerated (“Christ lives in me”), and **(4)** personally united with the
Savior (“crucified with Christ”). Four times in this one verse Paul used the
first-person pronoun (egō, emou, me, emoi). Jewett’s comment again
proves instructive: “The individual quality in God’s electing love is
reflected in the use of the singular personal pronoun in Scripture. . . . To
be elect is to be aware that God has fixed his love on me, called me by
name, given me a new name (Rev 2:17), and inscribed my name in the
Book.”<sup>124</sup> God had a plan for Saul/Paul and worked efficiently to bring
him to faith in Christ. The same could not be said for God’s relation to
Judas, Pilate, or Herod.
>
A comprehensive Pauline text dealing with election is Eph 1:3-14,
which we analyze as follows. **(1)** The source of election: “the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms
with every spiritual blessing in Christ” (v. 3). Election is a monogeristic
operation of God, not a synergism (cf. 2 Tim 1:9). **(2)** The fact of election: “we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will” (v. 11; cf. vv. 4-5, 9). Paul’s election words in the preceding verses are heaped one upon the another, powerful and descriptive of what God himself accomplishes: eklegō, to “choose out,” “select;”<sup>125</sup> kleroō, to “choose,” “destine”; proorizō, to “foreordain,” “predestine”; protithēmi, to “purpose,” “intend”; prothesis, “plan,” “purpose,” “resolve;”<sup>126</sup> boulē, “an intention” or “deliberation” (with emphasis on the deliberative aspect of the decision;<sup>127</sup> thelēma, “will” or “intention”—i.e., “God’s eternal and providential saving will,”<sup>128</sup> with emphasis on the volitional aspect or the will in exercise; and eudokia, “good pleasure,” “act of the will”—a choice grounded in God’s sovereign purpose.<sup>129</sup> 
>
**(3)** The time of election: from eternity past, i.e., “before the creation of the world” (v. 4; cf. 2 Thess 2:13; 2 Tim 1:9). Salvation is the unfolding
of God’s eternal purpose. “The Scriptures say that God chose us in Christ
from before the foundation of the world, not that he saw us from before
the foundation of the world as choosing Christ.”<sup>130</sup> **(4)** the objects of election: “we” (v. 7) or “us” (vv. 3-6, 8-9). Paul envisaged the elect both in their corporate standing as the church and in their individuality. The latter is clear in Rom 16:13, where Paul wrote, “Greet Rufus, chosen (ton
eklekton) in the Lord,” and in 1 Pet 1:1, discussed below. The people of
God are viewed both in their unity and in their diversity (Rom 12:4-5; 1
Cor 10:17; 12:12, 20; Eph 4:25; 5:30; Col 3:15). Berkouwer made this
important observation: “We are repeatedly struck by the lack of tension
between the election of the individual and the election of the church....
The life of the individual does not dissolve into the community”131
(emphasis added). Every social unit must be defined in terms of the individuals that comprise it. The NT designates Christians as “believers,”
“saints,” and “elect.” No one doubts that it is the individual that believes
and is sanctified. So ultimately it is the individual who is loved and chosen by God. Luther captured this individual dimension of salvation, often
obscured by corporate advocates, when he wrote, “You must do your own
believing, as you must do your own dying.”132
>
**(5)** The sphere of election: “in Christ” (vv. 3-7, 9, 11; 3:11; 2 Tim 1:9). Arminians interpret “in Christ” as elect according to our quality as believers. Predestination “in Christ,” however, affirms God’s purpose to effect salvation through the person and work of Jesus Christ (vv. 5, 7; cf. Rom 6:23b; 2 Tim 1:9b). “Christ is the medium for the imparting of grace.”133
The phrase “in Christ” positively excludes a works-effected salvation. **(6)** The motive of election: God’s freely conceived and unconditional love. So
Paul wrote, “in love he predestined us” (vv. 4-5). **(7)** The impartiality of election: “in accordance with his pleasure and will” (v. 5; cf. Rom 2:11;
11:34). God’s choice was not motivated by the faintest hint of favoritism.
Finally, **(8)** the goal of election: that believers might “be holy and blameless in his sight” (v. 4), and that they might live “to the praise of his glorious grace” (v. 6). The outcome, not the condition, of election is
righteousness of life.
>
To encourage Thessalonian Christians who were severely persecuted,
Paul wrote that the God who had chosen them for salvation from eternity
past and called them to Christ would sustain them in their present trials (2
Thess 2:13-14). Sorely tempted to renounce Christ, the believers would
have found little consolation in the reminder that it was they who had chosen God. Rather, the supreme encouragement in a situation where their
human resources were failing was that God had chosen them for an enduring salvation. So the apostle wrote, “we . . . thank God for you, brothers
loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose [eilato] you to
be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in
the truth.” The middle voice of a verb denotes the subject acting with
respect to itself. Here the aorist middle indicative of haireomai (to “choose,” “prefer,” “decide”) “emphasizes . . . the relation of the person
chosen to the special purpose of him who chooses. The ‘chosen’ are
regarded . . . as they stand to the counsel of God.”<sup>134</sup> See also 1 Thess 1:4­-5, where the saints’ response to the Gospel was evidence of their prior election. Election in eternity past was actualized in time by the sanctifying work of the Spirit and the Thessalonians’ belief in the Gospel as preached by Paul. 2 Thess 2:13 (NRSV) indicates that God actively chose them specifically “for salvation” (eis sōtērian). Paul also stated this truism in 1 Thess 5:9 when he wrote, “God. . . [appointed] us . . . to receive salvation” (eis peripoiēsin sōtērias).<sup>135</sup> To the Christian’s experiential question, Why am I a Christian?, the biblically faithful answer must be, Because God chose me.
>
James also stated that the initiative in salvation lies wholly with the sovereign God: “He chose [boulētheis] us to give us birth through the word
of truth” (Jas 1:18). Jude 1 affirmed the same in its description of
Christians as people “called,” “loved,” and “kept” by God. Observe that
it is fundamentally the individual (and by extension the class) who is
“loved” and “kept” by God; so also it is the individual who is “called”
by God. Peter viewed the body of Christ as the new people of God (1 Pet
2:9-10); yet within this new entity he saw the election of individuals to salvation. So Peter wrote his first letter to “God’s elect [eklektois], strangers in the world, scattered” throughout much of Asia Minor (1 Pet 1:1). Since individuals, not a class, scatter or are dispersed, Peter had in mind an aggregate of individuals, not an empty class. The elect ones “have been chosen according to [kata] the foreknowledge [prognōsin] of God the
Father, through (en) the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for [eis] obedience
to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood” (v. 2). Several comments on
this verse are in order. **(1)** The preposition kata indicates the basis of divine election—namely, the divine foreknowledge. In context, prognōsis denotes the divine foreloving or foreordaining, or as Selwyn stated, God’s “knowing or taking note of those whom He will choose.”<sup>136</sup> That God’s foreknowledge of Christians likely indicates more than prescience is confirmed by Peter’s statement that Christ “was chosen (perfect passive participle of proginōskō) before the creation of the world” (1 Pet 1:20; “He was destined,” RSV, NRSV; cf. Acts 2:23). 1 Pet 1:2 says nothing about Christians being chosen on the basis of foreseen faith. **(2)** The preposition en signifies the means by which eternal election was effected in time—i.e., by operation of the Spirit. And **(3)** the preposition eis denotes the goal or outcome of election—i.e., obedience to Christ and the application of his atoning benefits. Peter did not state that those who obey Christ are elect, but that the elect proceed to obey Christ. See also Jas 2:5.
>
In 2 Pet 1:10 the disciple wrote to the dispersed believers, “Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election
[eklogē] sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall.” Truly it is
not the undifferentiated group that falls or fails to persevere, but individuals who are here considered aggregately. Moreover, the brothers confirm their calling and election by cultivating the qualities listed in vv. 5-7, namely, “faith,” “goodness,” “knowledge,” “self-control,” “perseverance,” “godliness,” “brotherly kindness,” and “love.” These too are
activities of individuals, not of an empty group or class. Therefore if we
talk of the election of a class, it must be as the sum of elect individuals.

> **A. Does the New Testament Teach Predestination?**
>
> Several passages in the New Testament seem to affirm quite clearly that God ordained beforehand those who would be saved. For example, when Paul and Barnabas began to preach to the Gentiles in Antioch in Pisidia, Luke writes, “And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of God; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed” (Acts 13:48). It is significant that Luke mentions the fact of election almost in passing. It is as if this were the normal occurrence when the gospel was preached. How many believed? “As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.”
>
In Romans 8:28 – 30, we read:
>
>>We know that in everything God works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified. 3
>
In the following chapter, when talking about God’s chosing Jacob and not Esau, Paul says it was not because of anything that Jacob or Esau had done, but simply in order that God’s purpose of election might continue.
>
Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad, in order that God’s purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of his call, she was told, “The elder will serve the younger.” As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” (Rom. 9:11 – 13)
>
Regarding the fact that some of the people of Israel were saved, but others were not, Paul says: “Israel failed to obtain what it sought. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened” (Rom. 11:7). Here again Paul indicates two distinct groups within the people of Israel. Those who were “the elect” obtained the salvation that they sought, while those who were not the elect simply “were hardened.”
>
Paul talks explicitly about God’s choice of believers before the foundation of the world in the beginning of Ephesians.
>
“He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. He destined us in love to be his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace.” (Eph. 1:4 – 6)
>
Here Paul is writing to believers and he specifically says that God “chose us” in Christ, referring to believers generally. In a similar way, several verses later he says, “We who first hoped in Christ have been destined and appointed to live for the praise of his glory” (Eph. 1:12).
>
He writes to the Thessalonians, “For we know, brethren beloved by God, that he has chosen you; for our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction” (1 Thess. 1:4 – 5).
>
Paul says that the fact that the Thessalonians believed the gospel when he preached it (“for our gospel came to you . . . in power . . . and with full conviction”) is the reason he knows that God chose them. As soon as they came to faith Paul concluded that long ago God had chosen them, and therefore they had believed when he preached. He later writes to the same church, “We are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth” (2 Thess. 2:13).
>
Although the next text does not specifically mention the election of human beings, it is interesting at this point also to notice what Paul says about angels. When he gives a solemn command to Timothy, he writes, “In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without favor” (1 Tim. 5:21). Paul is aware that there are good angels witnessing his command and witnessing Timothy’s response to it, and he is so sure that it is God’s act of election that has affected every one of those good angels that he can call them “elect angels.”
>
When Paul talks about the reason why God saved us and called us to himself, he explicitly denies that it was because of our works, but points rather to God’s own purpose and his unmerited grace in eternity past. He says God is the one “who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not in virtue of our works but in virtue of his own purpose and the grace which he gave us in Christ Jesus ages ago” (2 Tim. 1:9).
>
When Peter writes an epistle to hundreds of Christians in many churches in Asia Minor, he writes, “To God’s elect . . . scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia” (1 Peter 1:1 NIV). He later calls them “a chosen race” (1 Peter 2:9).
>
In John’s vision in Revelation, those who do not give in to persecution and begin to worship the beast are persons whose names have been written in the book of life before the foundation of the world: “And authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation, and all who dwell on earth will worship it, every one whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain” (Rev. 13:7 – 8)4 In a similar way, we read of the beast from the bottomless pit in Revelation 17: “The dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will marvel to behold the beast, because it was and is not and is to come” (Rev. 17:8).

<a name="mod-reformed-compat" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.2 Moderate Reformed Compatibilism</a>

Reformed compatibilists are moderate 4-point Calvinists or amyraldians who also hold God's sovereignty (Calvinism) and to libertarian versions of free will (Arminian), but lean reformed. They're similar to <a href="#mod-arm-compat">Moderate Arminian Compatibilists</a>, but they lean reformed instead.

<a name="martin" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">1.2.1 Dr. Walter Martin</a>

Martin is quoted by Rhodes, who is a moderate 4-point Calvinist (Amyraldian), so it would seem that Martin is reformed leaning. What we do know for certain is that he was a moderate who emphasized God's sovereignty over human free will, but also, like Rhodes, believes in free will. This is known as compatibilism.

> **Sovereignty and free will. Is it one or the other, or is it both one and the other? The Bible says both.** In the first chapter we saw that God is sovereign over all things, including human events and free choices. Nothing catches God by surprise, and nothing is outside His control (see chapter 1). On the other hand, in this chapter we have seen that human beings, even in their fallen state, have the God-given power of free choice. &mdash; Chosen but free.

> **Moderate Calvinists like myself** are willing to affirm that God can be as persuasive as He desires to be, short of coercion. In theological terms, this means God can use irresistible grace on the willing. &mdash; Chosen but free.

> **Unconditional election is also held by moderate Calvinists.** It is unconditional from the standpoint of the Giver, even though there is one condition for the receiver—faith. &mdash; Chosen but free.

> **Moderate Calvinists, such as I am**, differ with Arminians on many points. One crucial point has to do with whether or not “once saved, always saved” is accurate. That is, whether or not it is possible to lose one’s salvation. It is my conviction that the Bible favors the Calvinist’s position of eternal security—that a truly saved person can never lose his/her salvation. &mdash; Chosen but free.

> In spite of the fact that The Potter’s Freedom (hereafter PF) is **a sharp critique of my moderate Calvinism**, strangely enough, I found myself agreeing with much of what it says.
>
>> All in all, The Potter’s Freedom is a good critique. But unfortunately, it is not a critique of my view. It often misunderstands, misrepresents, and mischaracterizes the moderate Calvinistic presentation of Chosen But Free. PF is permeated with logical fallacies and reveals an inadequate comprehension of the unjustified theological and philosophical underpinnings of extreme Calvinism. By distorting the obvious, caricaturizing the opposing, and sidestepping the dif icult, PF futilely attempts to make the implausible sound plausible and the unbiblical seem biblical.

**A. Conditional Election
(Classical Arminians)**
>
Many early church Fathers, concerned to avoid pagan fatalism and Gnostic
determinism, stressed the freedom of the human will and its ability to
repent and exercise faith. A number of pre-Augustinian authorities thus
viewed salvation synergistically, the human will freely cooperating with the
Spirit to the attainment of salvation. Origen (d. 254) held that the predestination language of the Bible encouraged pagan fatalism. Thus he based
election on divine foreknowledge of free, human actions. He wrote:
>
>>Foreknowledge precedes foreordination. . . . God observed beforehand the sequence of future events, and noticed the inclination of
some men towards piety which followed on this inclination; and he
foreknew them, knowing the present and foreknowing the future. . . .
If anyone in reply asks whether it is possible for the events which
God foreknew not to happen, we shall answer, Yes, and there is no
necessity determining this happening or not happening.<sup>3</sup>
> Commenting on 2 Tim 2:20-21, Origen denied that before time God
made persons into vessels of honor or dishonor. Rather, “he makes those
into vessels of honor who purge themselves and those into vessels of dishonor who allow themselves to remain unpurged.”4 Origen held that in
the end all persons will, in fact, choose God and so be saved.
>
John Chrysostom of Antioch (d. 407) likewise emphasized the human initiative in salvation. “The Lord has made our nature free to choose. Nor
does he impose necessity on us, but furnishes suitable remedies and allows
everything to hinge on the sick man’s own judgment.” God elects persons
on the basis of his foreknowledge of their personal worthiness. Chrysostom
continued, “In order that not everything may depend on divine help, we
must at the same time bring something ourselves.”5 Calvin judged that
many pre-Augustinian fathers resisted the doctrine of sovereign election **(1)**
so as to accommodate their views to influential worldly philosophers, and
**(2)** to avoid the Christians’ constant tendency to slothfulness.<sup>6</sup>
Fourth-century Semi-Pelagians in Southern France—notably John
>
Cassian (d. 435), Vincent of Lérins (d. 434), Hilary of Arles (d. 449), and
Faustus of Riez (d. 490)—believed that the weakened (but not lifeless)
human will initiates the first movement to God. At that point divine grace
assists the prior human response. The Semi-Pelagians rejected unconditional predestination, holding that it would contradict human freedom and
responsibility and that it would render preaching and pastoral care unnecessary. Ultimately they regarded unconditional predestination as a fatalistic doctrine. The Semi-Pelagians explained the doctrine conditionally as the divine foreknowledge of human faith and works. Cassian, who had a high
estimate of unregenerate human nature, rejected unconditional personal
election. “How can we imagine without grievous blasphemy that He does
not generally will all men, but only some, instead of all to be saved?”7
Hilary of Arles disputed Augustine’s doctrines of grace and election. He
judged that God foreknew or predestined those who would believe, and to
these God arranged for the Gospel to be preached. The Synod of Orange
condemned the Semi-Pelagians, also known as Semi-Augustinians, in 529.
>
**Traditional Roman Catholicism** claims that although the gift of superadded righteousness was lost at the Fall, sinners retain the capacity for
willing and doing the good. In the state of nature sinners long for the
reception of grace (desiderium naturale) and possess the capacity for
receiving grace (potentia obedientais). God responds to the human aspiration for him at baptism by bestowing sanctifying grace, which remits
original sin and unites the soul to Christ. God then provides additional
grace through the sacraments of penance and the Eucharist and the teachings of the church. As individuals cooperate with these means of grace,
they are enabled to perform meritorious works (rosary prayers, fasting,
giving, etc.) that effect moral improvement. In this way humans contribute
to their salvation. **Catholicism** thus is Semi-Pelagian in its belief that “man
really cooperates in his personal salvation from sin.”<sup>8</sup>
>
**Catholics** generally believe that God predestines to heaven all who die
in a state of grace and consigns to hell all who die in a state of sin. In the process of salvation the ‘elect’ are able to fall from grace, and the ‘nonelect’ have the power to rise to salvation on their death beds.
Predestination in the Roman system thus signifies God’s prevision of a person’s free choices and meritorious works. “Heaven is not given to the elect
by a purely arbitrary act of God’s will, but it is also the reward of the personal merits of the justified.”9 Mainstream **Catholicism** rejects the
Augustinian doctrine of sovereign election as inconsistent with divine love
and Christ’s death for the entire world.
>
The so-called ‘Arminians’ begin with the philosophical premise that in
regard to human destiny God’s sovereign choice would be incompatible
with human freedom. Christ died for all, and God wills that all people be
saved (1 Tim 2:4; 2 Pet 3:9). Moreover, personal obligation is limited to
one’s ability to perform. Since the command to trust Christ is universal,
Arminians claim that all persons have the capacity to respond to the
Gospel. The tradition claims that God restores to sinners universally the
ability to believe through the operation of prevenient grace that mitigates
inherited depravity. Arminians define election as God’s general purpose to
save those he foresaw would respond to prevenient grace, repent, and
believe. They speak of God electing the class of people who exhibit a certain kind of character. “The basis for this divine choice is in the moral
character which they have been enabled, through God’s transforming
grace, to embody and experience.”<sup>10</sup> Salvation, then, is synergistic; both
divine grace and the human will are causes of salvation. According to one
authority: “There is a cooperation, or synergism, between divine grace and
the human will. The Spirit of God does not work irresistibly, but through
the concurrence of the free will of individuals.”11
>
James Arminius (d. 1609) was a Leiden scholar who disputed the
Calvinist views on predestination, limited Atonement, and the bondage of
the sinner’s will. In formulating his views Arminius reacted particularly
against the high Calvinism (double predestination) of Beza and Gomarus,
which he judged to be unjust and unworthy of God. How could God be
fair, he reasoned, if he condemns persons who have no opportunity to alter
their situation because not sovereignly elected? Moreover, Arminius
alleged that the Calvinist denial of free will dehumanizes persons. On the
contrary, pre-Christians retain free will, defined as the power of contrary
choice spiritually. Even more soberly the Arminians judged that the doctrine of double predestination would make God the author of sin.
>
According to Arminius, God established four principal decrees concerning salvation. The first focuses on the election of Jesus Christ. God
unconditionally appointed Jesus Christ to be the Savior of humankind.
What is unconditionally predestined is Christ or the way of salvation. The second focuses on the election of the people of God. God further decreed
unconditionally that the class of people who adhere to this way of salvation will be saved. “He decreed to receive into favor those who repent and
believe, and, in Christ . . . to effect the salvation of such penitents and
believers as persevere to the end.”<sup>12</sup> The third relates to the provision of
prevenient grace. God supplies all persons with “exciting” grace, which
mitigates the effects of original sin and enables sinners to respond to the
Gospel call. God confers on all people grace sufficient for salvation; it is up to the individual to believe or not believe, to be saved or not be saved. The fourth decree concerns the election of individuals on the basis of foreknowledge. God elects to life those he foresees will believe and persevere, and he punishes those who refuse to do so. “This decree has its formulation in the foreknowledge of God, by which he knew from all eternity those individuals who would, through his preventing grace, believe, and through his subsequent grace would persevere.”<sup>13</sup> In other words, God chose those he foresaw would choose him. Hence the determining factor as to whether an individual will be saved or not is his or her own free decision.
>
Article I of The Five Articles of the Remonstrants (1610) affirms predestination based on divine foreknowledge of human faith and perseverance. The Remonstrants were forty-two followers of James Arminius who
presented their anti-Calvinist articles to the governing body of the
Netherlands at the Hague in 1610. The Synod of Dort (1618-19) judged
the Five Articles contrary to Scripture and declared the Five Points of
Calvinism the official position of the churches. Many Remonstrant pastors were dismissed from their pulpits and were not welcomed back to the
Netherlands. Article I reads as follows:
>
>> That God, by an eternal, unchangeable purpose in Jesus Christ his
Son, before the foundation of the world, hath determined, out of the
fallen, sinful race of men, to save in Christ . . . those who, through
the grace of the Holy Ghost, shall believe on this his Son Jesus, and
shall persevere in this faith and obedience of faith . . . even to the end;
and on the other hand, to leave the incorrigible and unbelieving in
sin and under wrath, and to condemn them as alienated from Christ.
>
John Wesley (d. 1791), the founder of Methodism, was influenced by
the theology of the Eastern Fathers and by contemporary Anglicanism that
had drifted from a Reformed to an Arminian stance. Moreover, the leader
of the Oxford “holy club” stated, “I reject the blasphemy clearly contained in the horrible decree of predestination. . . . I would sooner be a
Turk, a Deist, yea an atheist, than I could believe this.”<sup>14</sup> Wesley strongly opposed Reformed views on predestination in The Arminian Magazine (1778-91) and elsewhere, for several reasons. **(1)** He judged that unconditional election to life necessarily implied unconditional reprobation to death—which doctrine would make God the author of sin. “Election cannot stand without reprobation. Whom God passes by, those he reprobates. It is one and the same thing.”<sup>15</sup> **(2)** Sovereign election renders preaching vain, for the elect then would be saved with or without preaching, and the non-elect to whom the Gospel is preached could not possibly be saved. **(3)** The Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election undermines biblical holiness, in that it removes the primary motivation to virtuous living, namely, the promise of rewards and the threat of punishment. “The doctrine [of election] . . . has a tendency to destroy holiness; for it wholly takes away those first motives to follow after it . . . the hope of future reward and punishment, the hope of heaven and the fear of hell.”<sup>16</sup> **(4)** The doctrine allegedly destroys Christians’ zeal for good works, if it be that human destinies have been settled from eternity past. And **(5)** unconditional election makes Christ a hypocrite for pretending love for, and inviting repentance from, persons allegedly reprobated by God.
>
Positively, Wesley insisted that Christ died for all and his grace is available to all. Viewed as a seamless garment, divine grace universally restrains evil, removes the guilt and penalty of original sin, convicts of sin and judgment, provides the first wish to please God, and imparts power to repent and believe. Thus, “preventing grace” heals the damaging effects of
Adamic sin universally. To those who respond to prevenient grace and
choose Christ, God grants justifying grace followed by sanctifying grace.
Wesley saw two elections in Scripture: **(1)** an unconditional election of
individuals to service and nations to privileges, and **(2)** a conditional election of persons to eternal destiny. Concerning the latter, God in eternity
past elected those persons he foresaw would believe and persevere in holy
living. Wesley thus understood election in the weaker sense of God’s ratification of foreseen human choices. He wrote:
>
>> I believe election commonly means one of these two things: First, a
divine appointment of some particular men to do some particular
work in the world. And this election I believe to be not only personal, but absolute and unconditional. Thus Cyrus was elected. . . .
I believe election means . . . a divine appointment of some men to
eternal happiness. But I believe this election to be conditional, as
well as the reprobation opposite thereto.<sup>17</sup>
>
**Wesley’s view of salvation as a series of moments in which God offers
people resistible grace more closely resembles the classical Roman
Catholic rather than the Reformation view.** 
>
Charles G. Finney (d. 1875), the Congregationalist pastor and evangelist, held that God’s government of the world divides people into two classes: the salvable and the unsalvable. The salvable are those whom God knows are capable of bringing forth saving faith. Finney defined election as the divine foresight of personal salvability. The ground of God’s election is the presence of something in sinners that makes it possible and wise for God to save them. Finney believed that the elect were chosen to eternal life on the condition that God foresaw that in the perfect exercise of their freedom they could be persuaded to repent and embrace the Gospel. “Upon some God foresaw that he could wisely bestow a sufficient measure of gracious influence to secure their voluntary yielding, and upon others he could not bestow enough in fact to secure this result. . . . In all this there was nothing arbitrary or unjust. He does for all that he wisely can.”<sup>18</sup>

> **Election and predestination are Biblical doctrines.** God knows everything and therefore He cannot be surprised by anything. He is beyond the constraints of mass, acceleration and gravity, therefore He is outside time. He knows, and has known from “eternity past,” who will exercise their free will to accept Him and who will reject Him. The former are “the elect” and the latter are the “non-elect.” Everyone who is not saved will have only himself to blame: God will not send anyone to hell, but many people will choose to go there by exercising their free will to reject Christ.

**B. Corporate Election
(Contemporary Arminians)**
>
This view represents a refinement of the traditional Arminian view of conditional election. Denying the radical depravity of sinners and the unconditional election of individuals to be saved, this school affirms that God wills to save all people and that Christ died for all. Evangelical interpreters view election passively as God’s purpose to save the class of people who trust Christ. In other words, election is a statement about the divine plan of salvation; it concerns God’s appointment of the believing community to everlasting glory. Accordingly, the dynamic whereby sinners come to Christ lies not with the sovereign God but with the unregenerate themselves.
>
Alan Richardson, former theologian at Nottingham and dean of York
Cathedral, averred that election is corporate, realized, and to service not to salvation. **(1)** Election is corporate. “The categories of predestination, foreknowledge, and so on, are valid . . . for the behavior of groups, but do not apply to this or that individual.”<sup>19</sup> In the OT election dealt with God’s
choice, not of individuals, but of the nation Israel (Deut 7:6-8; Ps 135:4) and of his Anointed to be the instruments of his purposes. This OT perspective carries over to the NT. Thus in Rom 8:28-30 that which God “foreknew” and “predestined” is the church corporately. According to Richardson:
>
>> If we read this passage as if it related to atomic individuals, we shall
create difficulties which are wholly of our imagining; we will then
have to ask why it was that God picked out some individuals, and
not others, and ‘predestined’ them to salvation since the foundation
of the world. Paul, of course, does not think of the Church as made up of a collection of individuals, but as a body: it is the body which is foreknown, foreordained, called, justified and is to be glorified.20
>
Likewise Romans 9–11 does not concern individuals but nations or representative rulers such as Pharaoh. Richardson argues that Christ is the
Elect One and those who are in the Son are the eklektoi. “If Christians are
‘the elect,’ it is because they are ‘in Christ,’ because they are baptized into the person of him who alone may with complete propriety be called the
Elect of God.”<sup>21</sup> 
>
**(2)** Election is realized. Romans 9–11, moreover, says nothing about salvation or damnation in the world-to-come, but about God’s purposes in history. “Election may be defined as the action of God’s grace in history” (emphasis added).<sup>22</sup> That is, the election of Israel, the Messiah, and the church has respect to a present, earthly mission among the nations (Isa 45:4-6; Mark 10:45). And **(3)** election is exclusively to service. God’s euloge has nothing to do with personal destiny in the age to come but everything to do with service for God in the world. “Election refers to God’s purpose in this world. It is true that the elected ones, if they do not fall away, will be saved in the world to come, but that is not the primary meaning of election. In the NT, as in the OT, election is a matter of service, not of privilege.”23
>
Richardson irresponsibly dissolves individual personhood and decisions
into the corporate unit. Thus in arguing for infant baptism, Richardson
avers that the faith of the family representative avails for the entire household. “The NT principle of representative faith is established. There is no place for our modern individualism in biblical thinking . . . the faith of one is available for those who are unable as yet to express their own faith.”<sup>24</sup> 
>
In their book God’s Strategy in Human History,<sup>25</sup> the laymen Forster and Marston propose a passive corporate election. The authors argue that Scripture does not teach sovereign election to salvation; people’s eternal destiny depends on their own moral responses to the universal offer of the Gospel. Jesus Christ is the chosen One, and Christians are said to be elect because through faith they are in Christ.<sup>26</sup> By the free responses of repentance and faith, people become part of Christ’s body, the church, and thus are described as chosen. Forster and Marston write:
>
>> The prime point is that the election of the church is a corporate
rather than an individual thing. It is not that individuals are in the
church because they are elect, it is rather that they are elect because
they are in the church, which is the body of the elect One. . . . A
Christian is not chosen to become part of Christ’s body, but in becoming part of that body [by free will, exercising faith] he partakes of Christ’s election.27
>
In other words, election or predestination points to the future and
describes the heavenly heritage of the people of God (Rom 8:28-30).
“Predestination does not concern who should be converted; it concerns
our future destiny. It is not that we are predestined to be Christians, it is
rather that as Christians we receive a glorious destiny.”<sup>28</sup> The sum of the matter is that God did not choose any individual to be saved; rather, corporately he has chosen in Christ the church to be heirs of heavenly glory.
>
William Klein, in The New Chosen People, avers that the Reformed
doctrine whereby God from eternity chose some individuals to be saved
and passed by others is “to most of us, a cause of bewilderment or frustration.... Such a claim . . . seems so arrogant, so exclusive.”<sup>29</sup> God does not select some sinners to be saved; he wills to save all who believe (Matt 18:14; 1 Tim 2:4; 2 Pet 3:9). Election in Scripture, he insists, has three meanings. **(1)** The most common use is God’s corporate choice of a people, Israel and the church, for spiritual privileges. Under the old economy
God chose national Israel to be his people (Deut 7:6; 14:2); so under the
new economy he chooses the people who believe in Christ (the church) to
be his elect. **(2)** There is God’s choice of individuals for service, viz.,
prophets, priests, kings, the seventy, and Christ’s apostles. Where election
focuses on individuals it is always to a task or ministry. And **(3)** election
concerns God’s unique choice of Jesus to perform his redemptive function.
>
Election to salvation, the immediate matter of concern, is a corporate
reality; God has chosen to save the body of believers (the people of God)
who have come to faith. The plural language of election (Rom 8:29-30;
Eph 1:4-5; 2 Thess 2:13; etc.) more adequately refers to the group as a
whole rather than to individuals. So the OT speaks of the chosen corporately as a “flock,” a “house,” and a “people,” and the NT a “body,” a
“bride,” and a “temple.” Writes Klein, “God has chosen the church as a
body rather than the specific individuals who populate that body.”<sup>30</sup> Since
Jesus Christ is God’s Elect One (1 Pet 1:20; 2:4, 6), and those who exercise saving faith are in Christ, Klein concludes that the latter group constitutes God’s chosen or “elect” people. His assumption is that since Jesus
and the apostles authentically proclaimed the Gospel universally, all persons are capable of repentance and faith. In particular, the opening of
Lydia’s heart that enabled her to respond to the Gospel (Acts 16:14), was
not caused by a special, effectual working of the Holy Spirit.<sup>31</sup> Klein claims
that this view of election is congruent with the biblical concept of corpo­rate solidarity, whereby God regards Israel and the church not as so many individuals but as a corporate reality.
>
Klein further argues that foreknowledge in the NT is not a synonym for
predetermination, even as the OT language “to know” (Jer 1:5; Amos 3:2)
and “to love” (Jer 31:3; Mal 1:2)—referred to individuals—do not mean
“to choose” savingly. The divine (fore)knowledge is not selective or elective. In sum, Klein defines election as God’s determination of the benefits that accrue to the people that believe—i.e., adoption into the family of God, conformity to Christ’s image, and future glory. “Paul’s concern in predestination is not how people become Christians nor who become
Christians, but to describe what God has foreordained on behalf of those
are (or will be) Christians.”32

**C. Double Unconditional Predestination
(High Calvinists)**
>
Some medieval theologians, Reformers, and high Calvinists concluded
from the logic of divine sovereignty that God in eternity past chose certain persons to be elected to life and others to be damned to death. They
judged the decree of reprobation to be the logical correlate of the decree
of election. God’s ordination of the two ends was entirely independent of
foreseen human merit or demerit. Concerning reprobation, the thesis of
permission was dismissed as undermining certainty of occurrence and thus
the divine sovereignty and rule.
>
Gottschalk of Orbais (d. 869), the Franciscan follower of Augustine, was
the first significant proponent of double predestination. Firmly opposed to
Semi-Pelagianism, Gottschalk became entangled in the logic of election and
reprobation. Proceeding from divine sovereignty, he argued that if God
elected some to life, he necessarily must have reprobated the others to
death, lest their destiny remain uncertain. His bottom line was, “There is
a twofold predestination, of the elect to blessedness, and of the reprobate
to death.”<sup>33</sup> Gottschalk was condemned by the Council of Quiercy (853)
for making God the author of sin. His works were burned, and he was
imprisoned in a monastery where maltreatment led to his death.
>
Ulrich Zwingli (d. 1531), the leader of the Reformation in Germanspeaking Switzerland, anticipated features of Calvin’s thought. Zwingli
believed that the sovereign God is the cause of every occurrence, predestination being a synonym for providence. “All things are so done and disposed by the providence of God that nothing takes place without his will
or command.”<sup>34</sup> Election or predestination is God’s free decision and is
not based on foresight of any human work or merit. “Predestination is the free disposition of God with regard to us, and is without any respect to
good or evil deeds.”<sup>35</sup> Accordingly, the exercise of faith follows election.
Zwingli regarded election and reprobation as two aspects of the sovereign
will. Since God before time unconditionally elected many to life, he also
fashioned many souls (Cain, Esau, Judas, Simon Magus, etc.) for reprobation to eternal death. Wrote Zwingli, “The bliss of everlasting life and
the pain of everlasting death are altogether matters of free election or rejection by the divine will.”36
>
Martin Luther (d. 1546) initially held to the conditional view of election advanced by the Schoolmen, but his study of the Bible and Augustine
led him to affirm unconditional election. Against Christian humanists
such as Erasmus, Luther insisted that because the sinner’s will is in
bondage to corruption, it consistently resists the truth of the Gospel. Thus
a person can be saved only through God’s will and working. “God has
taken salvation out of my will and has put it into His own and has
promised to save me, not by my own work or effort but by His grace and
mercy.”37
>
Luther steadfastly affirmed that God’s omnipotence is the cause of all
occurrences. God’s hidden will, into which humans dare not pry, includes
his unconditional predestination of some to be saved and his reprobation
of the rest to be damned. “God rejected a number of men and elected and
predestined others to everlasting life, such is the truth.”<sup>38</sup> On one hand,
God elected certain ones to be saved not on the basis of foreseen works
or merits but according to his own good pleasure. On the other hand, “the
will of the divine majesty purposely abandons and reprobates some to perish.”<sup>39</sup> This decree of reprobation is seen in God’s hatred of Esau (Rom
9:13), his hardening of Pharaoh’s heart (Rom 9:17-18), and his energizing Judas’ treachery. To say that the preceding occurred merely by divine
permission, in Luther’s words, is “double talk.”<sup>40</sup> That God hardens the
will of the reprobate while not sinning himself is a mystery embedded in
his hidden will.
>
John Calvin (d. 1564) discussed predestination in his Institutes of the
Christian Religion neither under the divine decrees nor under providence
but in the context of salvation and the Christian life. Stressing the absolute
sovereignty of God, Calvin attributed every occurrence to God’s efficient
will; he judged the thesis of permission a subterfuge that diminishes the
glory of God. Hence Calvin viewed election and reprobation as parallel
decrees within the single will of God. “We call predestination God’s eternal decree, by which he compacted with himself what he willed to become
of each man. For all are not created in equal condition; rather, eternal life
is foreordained for some, eternal damnation for others. Therefore, as any man has been created to one or other of these ends, we speak of him as
predestined to life or to death ”41
>
Concerning the decree of election, Calvin first spoke of a general,
covenantal election of ethnic Israel, which choice could be revoked by
national disobedience. More fundamentally, God eternally chose particular individuals, both among Israel (the “remnant”) and the Gentiles, for
an irrevocable spiritual heritage in Christ. “The general election of the
nation Israel does not prevent God from choosing in his most secret counsel those whom he pleases.”<sup>42</sup> Calvin noted the following characteristics
of election to life in Christ. **(1)** Election is according to God’s sovereign
will and good pleasure. It involves God’s unconditional choice of a man
or woman, not the latter’s choice of God. **(2)** Election is founded on freely
given mercy; God is under no obligation to save a single rebellious sinner.
**(3)** Election is not based on foreseen faith or holiness. Although God
knows all things in advance, biblical foreknowledge signifies the divine
determination to save specific persons. “The foreknowledge of God . . . is
not a bare prescience . . . but the adoption by which he had always distinguished his children from the reprobate.”<sup>43</sup> **(4)** Election is absolutely
certain as to its outcome. Since the omnipotent God infallibly accomplishes his purposes, all the elect will be saved. For Calvin election to life
is a doctrine for the comfort of Christians.
>
Calvin went beyond Augustine to assert that God unconditionally destined the majority of humanity to everlasting destruction. “Many . . .
accept election in such terms as to deny that anyone is condemned. But
they do this very ignorantly and childishly since election itself could not
stand except as set over against reprobation.”<sup>44</sup> Reprobation means that
God purposefully devoted to destruction whomsoever he pleased. “Since
the disposition of all things is in God’s hand, since the decision of salvation or of death rests in his power, he so ordains by his plan or will that among men some are born destined for certain death from the womb,
who glorify his name by their own destruction.”<sup>45</sup> God’s reprobation of
the non-elect occurred “for no other reason than that he wills to exclude
them from the inheritance which he predestines for his own children.”46
Calvin cited as leading examples of reprobation God’s rejection of Esau
while yet in his mother’s womb and his hardening of the heart of
Pharaoh. God implements his decree by withholding from the reprobate
his saving word or by depriving them of the capacity to understand it.
Calvin denied that his doctrine of reprobation is fatalistic, for it derives
not from the inner necessity of things (as in Stoicism) but from God’s universal rule. Likewise it is not unjust, for the reason that God’s will is the final standard of justice. The fact that God foreordains sin and then punishes sinners for their actions is a mystery to finite minds, hence Calvin’s reluctance to preach the doctrine. The truths of God’s sovereign disposition of all persons and human responsibility must be maintained, because the Bible teaches both.
>
Theodore Beza (d. 1605), Calvin’s successor at the Geneva Academy,
is commonly viewed as the “father of hyper-Calvinism.” Beza went
beyond Calvin by expounding predestination under the doctrine of God
and creation. Beza viewed God’s just and secret purpose as the efficient
cause of all occurrences. “Everything happens in the manner in which God
ordained it from eternity. He disposed the intermediate causes in such a
powerful and effective fashion that they were necessarily brought to the
appointed end to which He ordained them.”<sup>47</sup> Beza argued that God created some persons for life and others for damnation. Thus predestination
“is God’s eternal and unchangeable ordinance, which came before all the
causes of salvation and damnation, and by which God has determined to
glorify himself—in some men by saving them through his simple grace in
Christ and in other men by damning them through his rightful justice in
Adam and in themselves.”<sup>48</sup> Beza added that “The doctrine of foreseen
faith and foreseen works is contrary to the doctrine that preaches and
teaches the Word of God.”<sup>49</sup> Beza asserted that the reprobate are condemned for their own sin and lack of faith. He so argued by distinguishing between God’s decree of election and reprobation and the execution
of that decree. Although God willed salvation and damnation, his decree
was executed by the secondary means of faith and unbelief. By so reasoning, Beza sought to uphold human responsibility and to excuse God as
the author of sin. Ultimately Beza referred the preceding antimonies to the
mystery of the divine will.
>
John Bunyan (d. 1688), the English Baptist preacher and writer, is most
famous for his allegories Grace Abounding (1666) and The Pilgrim’s
Progress (1682). According to Bunyan, the whole of salvation rests on the
foundation of God’s sovereign election. Wrote he, “This act of God in
electing is a choosing or fore-appointing of some infallibly unto eternal
life.”<sup>50</sup> Election according to God’s good pleasure is **(1)** eternal, having
been executed before the foundation of the world, **(2)** unconditional, being
totally independent of foreseen faith or good works, and **(3)** effectual, in
that no impediment can hinder the realization of God’s purposes. Finally,
**(4)** election is “in Christ,” since the Savior is the one in whom the elect
were always considered and without whom there is neither election,
grace, nor salvation.
>
In a lengthy section entitled “Reprobation Asserted: or the Doctrine of
Eternal Election and Reprobation Promiscuously Handled,” Bunyan stated that the decree of reprobation is the logical correlate of election: “if not elect, what then but reprobate?”<sup>51</sup> The decree of reprobation was executed not on the basis of foreseen responses of sinners, but solely on the
basis of God’s pre-mundane purpose. Arising out of God’s sovereignty,
reprobation excludes creatures from the sphere of divine election and publicly displays his power and wrath. Bunyan supported his doctrine of
reprobation by appeal to Paul’s accounts of Jacob and Esau (Rom 9:10­
13), the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart (vv. 17-18), and the parable of the
potter and the clay (vv. 19-22). “This decree [of reprobation] is made sure
by the number, measure, and bounds of election; for election and reprobation do enclose all reasonable creatures . . . election, those that are set
apart for glory; and reprobation, those left out of this choice.”<sup>52</sup> Bunyan
further distinguished between the decisions of reprobation and foreordination. The latter, arising out of God’s justice, binds the reprobate over to everlasting punishment. “Sovereignty is according to the will of God, but justice according to the sin of man.”53

Some allege that the approximately ten references to God’s hardening of
Pharaoh’s heart (Exod 4:21; 7:3; 9:12; et al.) support the thesis of unconditional reprobation to damnation. But prior to mentioning the divine
hardening, Scripture indicates that Pharaoh freely opposed God’s purposes
(Exod 8:15, 19, 32; 9:7, 34, 35; et al.; cf. 13:15; 1 Sam 6:6). The Bible
does not explain the nature of the hardening, but it appears that God’s role
was that of confirming Pharaoh’s decisions rather than predetermining
them. The most coherent explanation of the hardening is that by withdrawing his sustaining Spirit and by giving Pharaoh up to his own
impulses, God permitted the Egyptian leader to actualize his hostile
designs (cf. Rom 1:24, 26, 28). The hardening thus represents God’s punishment of Pharaoh for rejecting God’s good purposes.
>
A similar situation occurred in the case of Sihon, king of the Amorites,
who refused to permit Israel to pass through his territory. Yet the Hebrews
so attributed ultimate causality to God that Moses could say, “God had
made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate” (Deut 2:30; cf. Num
21:23), even though God’s involvement was limited to permission of the
incident.<sup>137</sup> The language of rejection, common in the Psalms and indicated by the verbs zānaḥ (Ps 43:2; 44:9, 23; 60:1; etc.) and mā’as (Ps 53:5;
78:59, 67; 89:38), refers to a temporal forfeiture of privileges as a result
of deliberate covenant-breaking. God’s work among the Egyptians—
“whose hearts he turned to hate [śānē’] his people” (Ps 105:25)—should
be understood in the sense of his hardening of Pharaoh’s heart (for human
self-hardening, see Ps 95:8 and Prov 28:14). Scripture stops short of
ascribing sin to God’s efficient will, as indicated by repeated warnings of
judgments against evil practices (Ps 81:13-15; Ecc 11:9).
>
Some interpreters find support for the doctrine of reprobation in certain crucial sayings of Jesus. Jesus’ parable of the sheep and goats (Matt
25:31-46) differentiates between the sheep on the right hand (“blessed” by the Father) and the goats on the left (“cursed” [katēramenoi] by him).
Jesus stated that the righteous inherit the kingdom prepared specifically
for them (v. 34), whereas the accursed depart into the place of torment prepared, not for them, but for Satan and his angels (v. 41). As Brunner has
noted, “The distinctive element in the biblical statement is not the ‘congruity’ but the ‘incongruity’ of the ‘right hand and the left hand.’”<sup>138</sup> The saved are those whom God has chosen for eternal blessing; the lost are
those whom God has chosen to “leave” (aphiēmi, Luke 17:34-35) in their
self-willed state of sinful rebellion.
>
Paul’s reference to God’s hardening the human heart in Rom 9:18—
“God . . . hardens whom he wants to harden”—signifies not reprobation
but God’s ratification of the sinner’s determination to steel himself or herself against the divine will of pleasure. With Shedd we can say that God
hardens the hearts of the unsaved in two ways: **(1)** by permitting persons
to exercise their sinful wills, and **(2)** by withdrawing his grace so that their
sinful lusts go unchecked.<sup>139</sup> Paul’s statement that God “raised up”
(exēgeira) Pharaoh—the Hebrew of Exod 9:16 suggests that God merely
sustained Pharaoh in life (see the NRSV)—communicates God’s use of hardhearted Pharaoh in the outworking of his saving plan. The Lord was not,
however, the blameworthy cause of Pharaoh’s actions. God does not efficiently impel sinful rebellion, but he does give sinners sufficient rope to
hang themselves. According to Sproul, “It is not that God puts his hand
on them to create fresh evil in their hearts; he merely removes his holy
hand of restraint from them and lets them do their own will.”140
>
The analogy of the potter and the clay (Rom 9:20-21), whereby the
craftsman fashions out of the same lump “some pottery for noble purposes
(eis timēn) and some for common use (eis atimian)” registers the point
made earlier, that God purposefully sanctifies some people and leaves others in their sins. Cranfield helpfully comments, “It should be noted that
eis atimian implies menial use, not reprobation or destruction. The potter
does not make ordinary, everyday pots in order to destroy them.”141
Neither do vv. 22-23 support an unconditional predestination to destruction. They state that the saved were “prepared [proētoimasen] in advance
for glory,” whereas the lost are “prepared [katērtismena] for destruction.”
The fact that Paul here did not use the verb prokatartizō (cf. 2 Cor 9:5)
suggests that it is not God who reprobated in eternity; rather, sinners prepare themselves for destruction by their own refusal to repent. The emphasis in these verses is not upon God’s pre-mundane reprobation, but upon
the temporal postponement of his wrath against unbelievers who are ripe
for destruction. In sum, “there appears here no support for any dogma of
predestination to damnation, while the parallel foreordination to glory is stated with no uncertainty.”<sup>142</sup> The big idea of the potter and the clay analogy is God’s absolute right to deal with his creatures as he sovereignly
wills. Other texts adduced by some in support of reprobation, such as 1
Cor 9:27, Gal 4:30, 2 Tim 2:20, 3:8, likewise fall short of actually teaching what Calvin called the “horrible decree.”
>
Israel’s hardening (Rom 11:7, 25) and the Jews’ subsequent spiritual
insensitivity (Rom 11:8, 10) should be understood in the sense of Rom
9:18. With pleasure God willed the salvation of “a remnant” within the
family of Abraham (Rom 11:5); but with displeasure he permitted the
majority of Israelites to reject his offer of grace (v. 12). Thus we concur
with Brunner who stated that “there is no doctrine of a double decree in
the New Testament, and still less in the Old.”143
>
First Pet 2:8 affirms the divinely appointed ruin of those who persistently reject the Gospel. The antecedent of the clause—“which is also what
they were destined for” (etethēsan)—is not the verb “they disobey” (so
Calvin, Beza), but “they stumble.”<sup>144</sup> Hebrews’ mention of Israel’s hardness of heart in Egypt focuses on the individual as the cause of the hardening (Heb 3:8, 13, 15; 4:7). It may be that the aorist passive subjunctive,
sklērunthē (“that none of you may be hardened,” Heb 3:13) is properly
“understood as a passive of permission; i.e., ‘allow or permit one’s self to
be hardened.’”<sup>145</sup> Similarly, Esau was rejected by God only after he had
rejected divine grace freely offered (Heb 12:17). The teaching of Scripture
as a whole is that continued resistance to God’s grace produces a fixed
habit of opposition to God that is not easily broken.
>
In sum, the biblical evidence leads us to uphold ‘an election within an
election,’ namely **(1)** the corporate election of the people of God for
earthly privileges and eternal destiny, as well as **(2)** an election of individuals to the personal enjoyment of these blessings. Scripture leads us to posit first the election of the group (Israel and the church) and then the
personal election of those individuals who comprise the true, spiritual people of God.
>
The Roman and Arminian views posit sinful men and women as the
ultimate determiners of their own salvation, whereas Augustinians and
Reformed identify God as the ultimate and efficient cause of eternal
blessedness. According to the former traditions, the distinction between
the saved and the unsaved is grounded in the choice of the creature;
according to the latter, the distinction is grounded in the good pleasure and
will of God, however unclear the rationale thereof may be to us mortals.
The weight of biblical and historical evidence rests in favor of a single
unconditional election to life. This position holds that out of the mass of fallen and responsible humanity—for reasons known to himself—God in
grace chose some to be saved and to permit the others to persist in their
sin. **Against the symmetrical view of Romanists and Arminians (double
foreknowledge) and Hyper-Calvinists and Barthians (double predestination), the biblical evidence leads us to posit an asymmetrical view of soteriological purpose—namely, unconditional election to life and conditional
election to damnation. When we speak about damnation, we mean that
God predestines persons not to sin and disobedience but to the condemnation that issues from sin.**
>
**Concerning this doctrine of election to life, we concur with the carefully measured conclusion of Jewett, who wrote: “In my judgment, this
Augustinian approach reflects a much more impressive biblical and exegetical effort than does the Pelagian and Arminian view.”<sup>146</sup> We do not wish
to blow the importance of this debated doctrine of predestination out of
proportion. But neither do we neglect what is undoubtedly a significant
biblical theme. The following section will discuss the practical relevance
of the doctrine of election for the life of Christian believers.**

**D. Universal Election in Christ
(Barthians)**
>
From his belief that sin has destroyed the imago, Karl Barth (d. 1968)
asserted that sinners are powerless to facilitate their own salvation.
Through grace alone God makes people what they cannot become by their
own decisions and actions. Consistent with his rigorous Christocentrism,
Barth viewed Jesus Christ and his electing activity as the grace of God. For
Barth election constitutes the heart of the Gospel. His reasons for rejecting the Augustinian and Calvinist view of election in favor of a novel
scheme of double predestination are as follows. **(1)** The Calvinist view
postulates a hidden, antecedent will of God independent of Jesus Christ,
who is the beginning and the sum of God’s saving purposes. **(2)** It regards
election as a static, fixed decision (“decretum absolutum”) rather than a
dynamic history between God and persons. And **(3)** it suggests that God
is for some persons and against others, whereas the Gospel is Good News
for all.
>
Barth developed his mature view of election in Church Dogmatics, volume II, part 2 under three headings. The first heading he entitled, “The
Election of Jesus Christ.” The cornerstone of his doctrine is that Jesus
Christ “is both the electing God and elected man in One.”<sup>54</sup> As the eternally electing God, Christ is the divine freedom in action. The Son of God,
in other words, is the subject who elects others. “Before him and without
him and beside him God does not, then, elect or will anything.”<sup>55</sup> But Jesus Christ also is the eternally elected man. As the Son of Man (with a
pre-existent humanity?) he is the object of God’s election. Negatively, this
means that Christ was elected to rejection. On the cross God said, “No”
to himself as Christ bore the sentence of man’s rejection. The elected man,
therefore, is also the rejected or reprobated man. Positively, Christ as
elected man means that God has chosen humankind for fellowship with
himself. At Calvary God said, “Yes” to his Son and to humanity in him.
“His election carries in it and with it the election of the rest.”<sup>56</sup> Barth thus asserted that “Predestination is the non-rejection of man. It is so because it is the rejection of the Son of God.”57
>
The second heading of Barth’s development is “The Election of the
Community.” From his exegesis of Romans 9–11, Barth concluded that
the people of God exist in the twofold form of Israel and the church. On
one hand, Christ is the crucified Messiah of Israel, which signifies the judgment he has taken upon himself. On the other hand, Christ is the risen
Lord of the church, which denotes the new man accepted and received by
God. The believing community witnesses to the divine election of the race
and the impossibility of resisting grace, and so summons the world to faith
in Christ. The church boldly testifies to the reality “that this choice of the
godless man is void; that he belongs eternally to Jesus Christ and therefore is not rejected, but elected by God in Jesus Christ.”58
>
Barth’s third heading is “The Election of the Individual.” Individual
election takes place in Jesus Christ and with the community (the latter taking priority over the individual). Barth reiterated that the individual, as
part of the human family, is already elected in Jesus Christ, the elected man
who bore his rejection. Thus each person is eternally loved and objectively
justified and sanctified in God’s Son. Even if an individual does not personally receive the Gospel, his or her unbelief is overcome by Christ’s election. So Barth stated, “This choice of the godless man is void; he belongs
eternally to Jesus Christ and therefore is not rejected, but elected by God
in Jesus Christ.”<sup>59</sup> The chief difference between explicit believers and
unbelievers is that the latter do not yet know they are elected. Thus Barth
often addressed general audiences as “dear brothers and sisters.”
Although Barth provided a theoretical basis for universal salvation, he
held that to conclude every person will be saved would limit God’s freedom. But since universal salvation is an affirmation of faith and hope,
Barth confidently trusted that all are saved.<sup>60</sup> In the end, divine grace triumphs over every form of sinful opposition.
>
Wolfhart Pannenberg (b. 1928) rejects the classical formulation of an
individualistic election from eternity. Rather he proposes “a concretely historical concept of election”<sup>61</sup> that affirms that through the medium of his­tory God fulfills his purpose to bring humanity to eternal communion with
himself. God has been accomplishing this salvific purpose for the race
through the election and history of Israel and the Christian church. Not
the sole purveyor of truth, the church functions as a sign and symbol of
the destiny of humankind in the future kingdom of God. Writes
Pannenberg, “The community of the church symbolizes the eschatological Kingdom of a new mankind in communion with God.”<sup>62</sup> Consisting
of people from all nations, the church witnesses to the fact that God willed
through Christ’s cross the reconciliation of the race. “The liberation from
the power of sin and death to the enjoyment of freedom in communion
with God is not meant for the Christians as the happy few. It is meant for
the whole world.”<sup>63</sup> Pannenberg believes that God’s loving purpose could
be none other than the salvation of the world, given men and women’s creation as image-bearers and their investiture with eternal value and dignity.

**Noun**: πρόγνωσις (prognōsis) GK 4590 (S 4268), 2x. prognosis means "foreknowledge." Two occurrences of the verb proginosko refer to human knowledge, namely, that someone "has known" some person or some Christian teaching "for a long time" (Acts 26:5;2 Pet. 3:17). The other three uses of the verb and the two uses of the noun refer to divine foreknowledge. Peter in his Pentecost message indicates that Jesus was delivered over to his enemies "by God's set purpose and foreknowledge" (Acts2:23).In fact, Jesus was divinely "chosen" to this task "before" the creation of the world (l Pet. 1:20). Peter also states that believers "have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God" (l Pet. l:2). Paul emphasizes the same message, .that "those God foreknew
he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son'? (Rom. 8:29; cf. also l1:2). We serve a God who knows all things and acts in accordance with his will.*

> 8:29 foreknew. Perhaps “knew ahead of time” (see Acts 26:5; 2 Pet 3:17, where the same Greek word is used): God “foreknew” who would believe in him and so predestined them. But “know” probably has the biblical sense of “enter into relationship with” (see Gen 18:19; Jer 1:5; Amos 3:2, where the same Hebrew word is translated “chosen,” “knew,” and “chosen,” respectively): God chose to initiate a relationship with people “before the creation of the world” (Eph 1:4; cf. Rom 11:2; Acts 2:23; 1 Pet 1:2, 20) and on that basis “predestined” them. &mdash; NIV, Biblical Theology Study Bible

<a name="ESVSB" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">6.6 ESV Study Bible</a>

> ... Foreknew reaches back to the OT, where the word “know” emphasizes God’s special choice of, or covenantal affection for, his people (e.g., Gen. 18:19; Jer. 1:5; Amos 3:2). See Rom. 11:2, where “foreknew” functions as the contrast to “rejected,” showing that it emphasizes God’s choosing his people (see also 1 Pet. 1:2, 20). God also predestined (i.e., predetermined) that those whom he chose beforehand would become like Christ. &mdash; ESV Study Bible

> 8:29 God foreknew, which means simply “to know beforehand.” This has been interpreted by some as God’s free and merciful choice of certain people who would receive His gift of salvation. Those who hold this view contend that His knowledge of future events and people did not determine His choice (see 1 Pet. 1:2). Instead He chose those who would be saved out of His own free will. Others believe that in His wisdom, God knew beforehand those who would respond to Him in faith. According to both views, only God saves; people never earn salvation through any work.

Strong’s #4309

To predestine means “to mark out beforehand,” “to establish one’s boundary, or one’s limits, beforehand.” Our English word horizon is a derivative of this Greek word. The Christian’s ultimate destiny or horizon has been fixed
by God from all eternity: to be made like His Son. Note how the words predestined, called, justified, and especially glorified in Rom. 8:29, 30 are in the past tense. That is because God, from His eternal perspective, sees this process as having been completed already. From God’s perspective, we have been glorified already because He sees us righteous because of the work of Jesus on the Cross. But still, in the march of time, we must undergo the process of being conformed to the image of God’s Son.

> 29: Foreknew . . . predestined, see Eph 1.4. Though from a human perspective God’s intention that humans be conformed to the image of God’s Son can be conceived as being prior in time, Paul affirms that there was never a moment when this was not God’s will. Firstborn, see v. 16–17; see also Col 1.15. 30: Glorified, is in the past tense, like “called” and “justified”; unlike v. 17, Paul sees temporality both from the human and divine perspective: though from our perspective being glorified is future, from God’s perspective it has already occurred since it is God’s will; see also v. 29n. &mdash; New Oxford Annotated (NOAB)
