# Who can find a virtuous and capable wife?

It is better to be alone (Pr 21:9, 19; 27:15) than to marry someone who does not fit this description.

> 
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> Who can find a virtuous and capable wife?<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">**She is more precious than rubies.**</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> **Her husband can trust her,**<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">**and she will greatly enrich his life.**</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> She brings him good, not harm,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">all the days of her life.</span><br>
> 
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> She finds wool and flax<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and busily spins it.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> She is like a merchant‚Äôs ship,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">bringing her food from afar.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> She gets up before dawn to prepare breakfast for her household<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and plan the day‚Äôs work for her servant girls.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> She goes to inspect a field and buys it;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">with her earnings she plants a vineyard.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> She is energetic and strong,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">a hard worker.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> She makes sure her dealings are profitable;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">her lamp burns late into the night.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> Her hands are busy spinning thread,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">her fingers twisting fiber.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> She extends a helping hand to the poor<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and opens her arms to the needy.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> She has no fear of winter for her household,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">for everyone has warm clothes.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> She makes her own bedspreads.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">She dresses in fine linen and purple gowns.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> Her husband is well known at the city gates,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">where he sits with the other civic leaders.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> She makes belted linen garments<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and sashes to sell to the merchants.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> She is clothed with strength and dignity,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and she laughs without fear of the future.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> When she speaks, her words are wise,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and she gives instructions with kindness.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> She carefully watches everything in her household<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and suffers nothing from laziness.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> Her children stand and bless her.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">Her husband praises her:</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> ‚ÄúThere are many virtuous and capable women in the world,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">but you surpass them all!‚Äù</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">but a woman who fears the Lord will be greatly praised.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">31</sup> Reward her for all she has done.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">Let her deeds publicly declare her praise.</span>
>
&mdash; Proverbs 31:10-31 NLT

The Definition of Love

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud <sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. &mdash; 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 NLT

# True Righteousness and Wisdom Are Virtually Nonexistent

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> And I find more bitter than death<br>
The woman whose heart is snares and nets,<br>
Whose hands are fetters.<br>
**He who pleases God shall escape from her,**<br>
**But the sinner shall be trapped by her.**<br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> ‚ÄúHere is what I have found,‚Äù says the Preacher,<br>
‚ÄúAdding one thing to the other to find out the reason,<br><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> Which my soul still seeks but I cannot find:<br>
**One man among a thousand I have found,<br>
But a woman among all these I have not found.**<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> Truly, this only I have found:<br>
That God made man upright,<br>
But they have sought out many schemes.‚Äù<br>
>
&mdash; Ecclesiastes 7:26-29 NKJV

# Admonitions and Warnings against Dangerous and Destructive Acts

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> To keep you from the evil woman,<br>
From the flattering tongue of a seductress.<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> Do not lust after her beauty in your heart,<br>
Nor let her allure you with her eyelids.<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> **For by means of a harlot**<br>
**A man is reduced to a crust of bread;**<br>
And an adulteress will prey upon his precious life.<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> Can a man take fire to his bosom,<br>
And his clothes not be burned?<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> Can one walk on hot coals,<br>
And his feet not be seared?<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> So is he who goes in to his neighbor‚Äôs wife;<br>
Whoever touches her shall not be innocent.

&mdash; Proverbs 6:24-29 NKJV

# Beware

> The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive [full of simpleness] and knows nothing. &mdash; Proverbs 9:13 ESV
