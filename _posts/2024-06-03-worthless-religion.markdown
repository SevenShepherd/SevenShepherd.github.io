If you are having a hard time locating sources of truth in Christianity, remember, [you will know them by their fruits](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/fruits/). Do not listen to a person who claims to be Christian and [pursues a lifestyle of sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/), they are not born again, do not accept their doctrine, do not walk their path. 

> ‚ÄúIf you claim to be religious but don‚Äôt control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless.‚Äù ‚Äï James 1:26

Some of them will have acquired wealth and mislead you with the false prosperity gospel (Mt 8:20; Heb 13:5; 1Tim 6:9-10), but they do not realize that they are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked (Rev 3:15-17 NET). [They make God want to vomit.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/lukewarm/)
