# Listen To The Story Of The Poor Wise Man

Personally, I enjoy the story with the modal nuance. Without the modal nuance the story would say that he saved the city but that no one remembered him, whereas with the modal nuance it says, that he could have saved the city but they were destroyed for not listening. It seems like there is more consequence for ignoring wisdom with this approach, but either way, the wisdom of the poor is despised by the world. What do you think will happen if you keep disregarding his message (Proverbs 29:1 NET)? 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth, and it is a great burden to me: <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> There was once a small city with a few men in it, and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> However, a poor but wise man lived in the city, and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">he could have delivered the city by his wisdom, but no one listened to that poor man</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, but **a poor man’s wisdom is despised**; no one ever listens to his advice. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 9:13-16 NET
>>
g. Ecclesiastes 9:15 **tn** Or “he delivered.” The verb וּמִלַּט (umillat, from מָלַט, malat, “to deliver”) is functioning either in an indicative sense (past definite action: “he delivered”) or in a modal sense (past potential: “he could have delivered”). The literal meaning of זָכַר (zakhar, “to remember”) in the following line harmonizes with the indicative: “but no one remembered that poor man [afterward].” However, the modal is supported by v. 16: “A poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.” This approach must nuance זָכַר (“to remember”) as “[no one] listened to [that poor man].” Most translations favor the indicative approach: “he delivered” or “he saved” (KJV, RSV, NRSV, NAB, ASV, NASB, MLB, NIV); however, some adopt the modal nuance: “he might have saved” (NEB, NJPS, NASB margin).

# God Has Told The Poor To Boast That Their Faith & Spiritual Standing Are Greater Than Those With Wealth

It's time for you to recognize that Christ (Mt 8:20) & the Apostles were poor, beaten, and were brutally treated and eventually murdered. If you flaunt your wealth in pride or believe in the false health & wealth prosperity Gospel, you are lost or being taken advantage of. This happens from a lack of understanding about biblical teaching, God does not look at things the way the world does (Isa 55:8-9; 1 Sam 16:7; James 4:4).

<!-- This happens because you don't understand the bible well enough to know that God doesn't look at things the way the world does. -->

So, will you listen? Lean not unto your own understanding (Proverbs 3:5), just listen to Christ (Lk 13:3; Mt 4:17). It's time to stop fighting against scripture. Surrender to the Lord of Destiny (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4). 

# Isaiah 53

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Who has believed what he has heard from us?<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> For he grew up before him like a young plant,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and like a root out of dry ground;</span><br>
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and no beauty that we should desire him.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> **He was despised and rejected by men,**<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">**a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;**</span><br>
**and as one from whom men hide their faces**<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">**he was despised, and we esteemed him not.**</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Surely he has borne our griefs<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and carried our sorrows;</span><br>
yet we esteemed him stricken,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">smitten by God, and afflicted.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> But he was pierced for our transgressions;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">he was crushed for our iniquities;</span><br>
upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and with his wounds we are healed.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> All we like sheep have gone astray;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">we have turned—every one—to his own way;</span><br>
and the LORD has laid on him<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">the iniquity of us all.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">yet he opened not his mouth;</span><br>
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">so he opened not his mouth.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> By oppression and judgment he was taken away;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and as for his generation, who considered</span><br>
that he was cut off out of the land of the living,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">stricken for the transgression of my people?</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> And they made his grave with the wicked<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and with a rich man in his death,</span><br>
although he had done no violence,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and there was no deceit in his mouth.</span><br>
>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> **Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him;** (cf. Ac 2:23)<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">he has put him to grief;</span><br>
when his soul makes an offering for guilt,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;</span><br>
the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;<br>
by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">make many to be accounted righteous,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and he shall bear their iniquities.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and he shall divide the spoil with the strong,</span><br>
because he poured out his soul to death<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and was numbered with the transgressors;</span><br>
yet he bore the sin of many,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and makes intercession for the transgressors.</span><br>
