# Listen To The Story Of The Poor Wise Man

Personally, I enjoy the story with the modal nuance. Without the modal nuance the story would say that he saved the city but that no one remembered him, whereas with the modal nuance it says, that he could have saved the city but they were destroyed for not listening. It seems like there is more consequence for ignoring wisdom with this approach, but either way, the wisdom of the poor is despised by the world. What do you think will happen if you keep disregarding his message (Proverbs 29:1 NET)? 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth, and it is a great burden to me: <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> There was once a small city with a few men in it, and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> However, a poor but wise man lived in the city, and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">he could have delivered the city by his wisdom, but no one listened to that poor man</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, but **a poor man’s wisdom is despised**; no one ever listens to his advice. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 9:13-16 NET

g. Ecclesiastes 9:15 **tn** Or “he delivered.” The verb וּמִלַּט (umillat, from מָלַט, malat, “to deliver”) is functioning either in an indicative sense (past definite action: “he delivered”) or in a modal sense (past potential: “he could have delivered”). The literal meaning of זָכַר (zakhar, “to remember”) in the following line harmonizes with the indicative: “but no one remembered that poor man [afterward].” However, the modal is supported by v. 16: “A poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.” This approach must nuance זָכַר (“to remember”) as “[no one] listened to [that poor man].” Most translations favor the indicative approach: “he delivered” or “he saved” (KJV, RSV, NRSV, NAB, ASV, NASB, MLB, NIV); however, some adopt the modal nuance: “he might have saved” (NEB, NJPS, NASB margin).

# God Has Told The Poor To Boast That Their Faith & Spiritual Standing Are Greater Than Those With Wealth

It's time for you to recognize that Christ (Mt 8:20) & the Apostles were poor, beaten, and were brutally treated and eventually murdered. If you flaunt your wealth in pride or believe in the false health & wealth prosperity Gospel, you are lost or being taken advantage of. This happens from a lack of understanding about biblical teaching, God does not look at things the way the world does (Isa 55:8-9; 1 Sam 16:7; James 4:4).

<!-- This happens because you don't understand the bible well enough to know that God doesn't look at things the way the world does. -->

So, will you listen? Lean not unto your own understanding (Proverbs 3:5), just listen to Christ (Lk 13:3; Mt 4:17). It's time to stop fighting against scripture. Surrender to the Lord of Destiny.
