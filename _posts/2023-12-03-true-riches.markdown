Christian it's time for you to recognize that Christ (Mt 8:20) & the Apostles were poor, beaten, and were brutally treated and eventually murdered. If you flaunt your wealth or believe in the false health & wealth prosperity Gospel, you are lost or begin taken advantage of. This happens because you don't understand the bible well enough to know that God doesn't look at things the way the world does.
