The Heidelberg Catechism was written in Heidelberg at the request of Elector Frederick III, ruler of the most influential German province, the Palatinate, from 1559 to 1576. This pious Christian prince commissioned Zacharius Ursinus, twenty-eight years of age and professor of theology at the Heidelberg University, and Caspar Olevianus, twenty-six years old and Frederick's court preacher, to prepare a catechism for instructing the youth and for guiding pastors and teachers. Frederick obtained the advice and cooperation of the entire theological faculty in the preparation of the Catechism. The Heidelberg Catechism was adopted by a Synod in Heidelberg and published in German with a preface by Frederick III, dated January 19, 1563. A second and third German edition, each with some small additions, as well as a Latin translation were published in Heidelberg in the same year.
>
The Catechism was soon divided into fifty-two sections, so that a section of the Catechism could be explained to the churches each Sunday of the year. In The Netherlands this Heidelberg Catechism became generally and favorably known almost as soon as it came from the press, mainly through the efforts of Petrus Dathenus, who translated it into the Dutch language and added this translation to his Dutch rendering of the Genevan Psalter, which was published in 1566. In the same year, Peter Gabriel set the example of explaining this catechism to his congregation at Amsterdam in his Sunday afternoon sermons.
>
The National Synods of the sixteenth century adopted it as one of the Three Forms of Unity, requiring office-bearers to subscribe to it and ministers to explain it to the churches. These requirements were strongly emphasized by the great Synod of Dort in 1618-19. The Heidelberg Catechism has been translated into many languages and is the most influential and the most generally accepted of the several catechisms of Reformation times.

<br><a name="Q1" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q1. What is your only comfort in life and death?</a><br>

<br><a name="Q2" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q2. What do you need to know in order to live and die in the joy of this comfort?</a><br>

A. First, how great my sins and misery are;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> second, how I am delivered from all my sins and misery;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> third, how I am to be thankful to God for such deliverance.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

A. From the law of God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

1. Rom. 3: 20;

<br><a name="Q4" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q4. What does God's law require of us?</a><br> A. Christ teaches us this in a summary in Matthew 22: You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Deut. 6:5. 
2. Lev. 19:18.

<br><a name="Q5" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q5. Can you keep all this perfectly?</a><br>

A. No,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> I am inclined by nature to hate God and my neighbour.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Rom. 3:10, 23; I John 1:8, 10. 
2. Gen. 6:5; 8:21; Jer. 17:9; Rom. 7:23; 8:7; Eph. 2:3; Tit. 3:3.

<br><a name="Q6" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q6. Did God, then, create man so wicked and perverse?</a><br>

A. No, on the contrary, God created man good<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and in His image,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> that is, in true righteousness and holiness,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> so that he might rightly know God His Creator,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal blessedness to praise and glorify Him.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

2. Gen. 1:26, 27. 
3. Eph. 4:24. 
4. Col. 3:10. 
5. Ps. 8.

<br><a name="Q7" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q7. From where, then, did man's depraved nature come?</a><br>

A. From the fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in Paradise,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> for there our nature became so corrupt<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> that we are all conceived and born in sin.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

1. Gen. 3. 
2. Rom. 5:12, 18, 19. 
3. Ps. 51:5.

<br><a name="Q8" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q8. But are we so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined to all evil?</a><br>

A. Yes,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> unless we are regenerated by the Spirit of God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Gen. 6:5; 8:21; Job 14:4; Is. 53:6. 
2. John 3:3-5.

<br><a name="Q9" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q9. Is God, then, not unjust by requiring in His law what man cannot do?</a><br>

A. No, for God so created man that he was able to do it.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But man, at the instigation of the devil,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> in deliberate disobedience<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> robbed himself and all his descendants of these gifts.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

1. Gen. 1:31. 
2. Gen. 3:13; John 8:44; I Tim. 2:13, 14. 
3. Gen. 3:6. 
4. Rom. 5:12, 18, 19.

<br><a name="Q10" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q10. Will God allow such disobedience and apostasy to go unpunished?</a><br>

A. Certainly not. He is terribly displeased with our original sin as well as our actual sins. Therefore He will punish them by a just judgment both now and eternally,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> as He has declared:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them (Galatians 3:10).

1. Ex. 34:7; Ps. 5:4-6; 7:10; Nah. 1:2; Rom. 1:18; 5:12; Eph. 5:6; Heb. 9:27. 
2. Deut. 27:26.

<br><a name="Q11" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q11. But is God not also merciful?</a><br>

A. God is indeed merciful,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> but He is also just.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> His justice requires that sin committed against the most high majesty of God also be punished with the most severe, that is, with everlasting, punishment of body and soul.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

1. Ex. 20:6; 34:6, 7; Ps. 103:8, 9. 
2. Ex. 20:5; 34:7; Deut. 7:9-11; Ps. 5:4-6; Heb. 10:30, 31. 
3. Matt. 25:45,46.

<br><a name="Q12" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q12. Since, according to God's righteous judgment we deserve temporal and eternal punishment, how can we escape this punishment and be again received into favour?</a><br>

A. God demands that His justice be satisfied.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Therefore full payment must be made either by ourselves or by another.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Ex. 20:5; 23:7; Rom. 2:1-11. 
2. Is. 53:11; Rom. 8:3, 4.

<br><a name="Q13" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q13. Can we ourselves make this payment?</a><br>

A. Certainly not. On the contrary, we daily increase our debt.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

1. Ps. 130:3; Matt. 6:12; Rom. 2:4, 5.

<br><a name="Q14" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q14. Can any mere creature pay for us?</a><br>

A. No. In the first place, God will not punish another creature for the sin which man has committed.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Furthermore, no mere creature can sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin and deliver others from it.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Ezek. 18:4, 20; Heb. 2:14-18. 
2. Ps. 130:3; Nah. 1:6.

<br><a name="Q15" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q15. What kind of mediator and deliverer must we seek?</a><br>

A. One who is a true<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and righteous<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> man, and yet more powerful than all creatures; that is, one who is at the same time true God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

1. I Cor. 15:21; Heb. 2:17. 
2. Is. 53:9; II Cor. 5:21; Heb. 7:26. 
3. Is. 7:14; 9:6; Jer. 23:6; John 1:1; Rom. 8:3, 4.

<br><a name="Q16" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q16. Why must He be a true and righteous man?</a><br>

A. He must be a true man because the justice of God requires that the same human nature which has sinned should pay for sin.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> He must be a righteous man because one who himself is a sinner cannot pay for others.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Rom: 5:12, 15; I Cor. 15:21; Heb. 2:14-16. 
2. Heb. 7:26, 27; I Pet. 3:18.

<br><a name="Q17" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q17. Why must He at the same time be true God?</a><br>

A. He must be true God so that by the power of His divine nature<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> He might bear in His human nature the burden of God's wrath,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and might obtain for us and restore to us righteousness and life.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

1. Is. 9:5. 
2. Deut. 4:24; Nah. 1:6; Ps. 130:3. 
3. Is. 53:5, 11; John 3:16; II Cor. 5:21.

<br><a name="Q18" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q18. But who is that Mediator who at the same time is true God and a true and righteous man?</a><br>

A. Our Lord Jesus Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> whom God made our wisdom, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption (I Corinthians 1:30).

1. Matt. 1:21-23; Luke 2:11; I Tim. 2:5; 3:16.

<br><a name="Q19" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q19. From where do you know this?</a><br>

A. From the holy gospel, which God Himself first revealed in Paradise.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Later, He had it proclaimed by the patriarchs<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and prophets,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and foreshadowed by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> Finally, He had it fulfilled through His only Son.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

1. Gen. 3:15. 
2. Gen. 12:3; 22:18; 49:10.

<br><a name="Q20" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q20. Are all men, then, saved by Christ just as they perished through Adam?</a><br>

A. No. Only those are saved who by a true faith are grafted into Christ and accept all His benefits.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

1. Matt. 7:14; John 1:12; 3:16, 18, 36; Rom. 11:16-21.

<br><a name="Q21" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q21. What is true faith?</a><br>

A. True faith is a sure knowledge whereby I accept as true all that God has revealed to us in His Word.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> At the same time it is a firm confidence<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> that not only to others, but also to me,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> God has granted forgiveness of sins, everlasting righteousness, and salvation,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> out of mere grace, only for the sake of Christ's merits.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> This faith the Holy Spirit works in my heart by the gospel.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>

<br><a name="Q22" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q22. What, then, must a Christian believe?</a><br>

A. All that is promised us in the Gospel,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> which the articles of our catholic and undoubted Christian faith teach us in a summary.

1. Matt. 28:19; John 20:30, 31.

<br><a name="Q23" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q23. What are these articles?</a><br>

<br><a name="Q24" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q24. How are these articles divided?</a><br>

A. Into three parts: the first is about God the Father and our creation; the second about God the Son and our redemption; the third about God the Holy Spirit and our sanctification.

<br><a name="Q25" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q25. Since there is only one God,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> why do you speak of three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?</a><br>

A. Because God has so revealed Himself in His Word<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> that these three distinct persons are the one, true, eternal God.

A. That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who out of nothing created heaven and earth and all that is in them,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and who still upholds and governs them by His eternal counsel and providence,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> is, for the sake of Christ His Son, my God and my Father.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> In Him I trust so completely as to have no doubt that He will provide me with all things necessary for body and soul,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> and will also turn to my good whatever adversity He sends me in this life of sorrow.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> He is able to do so as almighty God,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> and willing also as a faithful Father.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup>

<br><a name="Q29" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q29. Why is the Son of God called Jesus, that is, Saviour?</a><br>

A. No. Though they boast of Him in words, they in fact deny the only Saviour Jesus.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> For one of two things must be true: either Jesus is not a complete Saviour, or those who by true faith accept this Saviour must find in Him all that is necessary for their salvation.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<br><a name="Q32" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q32. Why are you called a Christian?</a><br>

A.

A. During all the time He lived on earth, but especially at the end, Christ bore in body and soul the wrath of God against the sin of the whole human race.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Thus, by His suffering, as the only atoning sacrifice,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> He has redeemed our body and soul from everlasting damnation,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and obtained for us the grace of God, righteousness, and eternal life.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

Only by true faith in Jesus Christ.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Although my conscience accuses me that I have grievously sinned against all God's commandments, have never kept any of them,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and am still inclined to all evil,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> yet God, without any merit of my own,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> out of mere grace,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> imputes to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> He grants these to me as if I had never had nor committed any sin, and as if I myself had accomplished all the obedience which Christ has rendered for me,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> if only I accept this gift with a believing heart.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup>

<br><a name="Q61" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q61. Why do you say that you are righteous only by faith?</a><br>

A. Not that I am acceptable to God on account of the worthiness of my faith, for only the satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ is my righteousness before God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> I can receive this righteousness and make it mine my own by faith only.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<br><a name="Q62" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q62. But why can our good works not be our righteousness before God, or at least a part of it?</a><br>

A. Because the righteousness which can stand before God's judgment must be absolutely perfect and in complete agreement with the law of God,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> whereas even our best works in this life are all imperfect and defiled with sin.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<br><a name="Q63" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q63. But do our good works earn nothing, even though God promises to reward them in this life and the next?</a><br>

A. This reward is not earned<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>; it is a gift of grace.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<br><a name="Q64" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q64. Does this teaching not make people careless and wicked?</a><br>

A. No. It is impossible that those grafted into Christ by true faith should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

<br><a name="Q65" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q65. Since then faith alone makes us share in Christ and all His benefits, where does this faith come from?</a><br>

A. From the Holy Spirit,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> who works it in our hearts by the preaching of the gospel,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and strengthens it by the use of the sacraments.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

1. John 3:5; I Cor. 2:10-14; Eph. 2:8; Phil. 1:29. 
2. Rom. 10:17; I Pet. 1:23-25.

<br><a name="Q66" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q66. What are the sacraments?</a><br>

A. The sacraments are holy, visible signs and seals. They were instituted by God so that by their use He might the more fully declare and seal to us the promise of the gospel.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> And this is the promise: that God graciously grants us forgiveness of sins and everlasting life because of the one sacrifice of Christ accomplished on the cross.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Gen. 17:11; Deut. 30:6; Rom. 4:11 
2. Matt. 26:27, 28; Acts 2:38; Heb. 10:10.

<br><a name="Q67" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q67. Are both the Word and the sacraments then intended to focus our faith on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross as the only ground of our salvation?</a><br>

A. Yes, indeed. The Holy Spirit teaches us in the gospel and assures us by the sacraments that our entire salvation rests on Christ's one sacrifice for us on the cross.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

1. Rom. 6:3; I Cor. 11:26; Gal. 3:27.

<br><a name="Q68" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q68. How many sacraments has Christ instituted in the new covenant?</a><br>

A. Two: holy baptism and the holy supper.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

1. Matt. 28:19, 20; I Cor. 11:23-26. Holy Baptism

<br><a name="Q69" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q69. How does holy baptism signify and seal to you that the one sacrifice of Christ on the cross benefits you?</a><br>

A. In this way: Christ instituted this outward washing<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and with it gave the promise that, as surely as water washes away the dirt from the body, so certainly His blood and Spirit wash away the impurity of my soul, that is, all my sins.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Matt. 28:19. 
2. Matt. 3:11; Mark 16:16; John 1:33; Acts 2:38; Rom. 6:3, 4; I Pet. 3:21. 

<br><a name="Q70" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q70. What does it mean to be washed with Christ's blood and Spirit?</a><br>

A. To be washed with Christ's blood means to receive forgiveness of sins from God, through grace, because of Christ's blood, poured out for us in His sacrifice on the cross.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> To be washed with His Spirit means to be renewed by the Holy Spirit and sanctified to be members of Christ, so that more and more we become dead to sin and lead a holy and blameless life.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Ez. 36:25; Zech. 13:1; Eph. 1:7; Heb. 12:24; I Pet. 1:2; Rev. 1:5; 7:14. 
2. John 3:5-8; Rom. 6:4; I Cor. 6:11; Col. 2:11, 12.

<br><a name="Q71" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q71. Where has Christ promised that He will wash us with His blood and Spirit as surely as we are washed with the water of baptism?</a><br>

A. In the institution of baptism, where He says: Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19). He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned (Mark 16:16). This promise is repeated where Scripture calls baptism the washing of regeneration and the washing away of sins (Titus 3:5; Acts 22:16).

<br><a name="Q72" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q72. Does this outward washing with water itself wash away sins?</a><br>

A. No, only the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit cleanse us from all sins.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

1. Matt. 3:11; I Pet. 3:21; I John 1:7.

<br><a name="Q73" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q73. Why then does the Holy Spirit call baptism the washing of regeneration and the washing away of sins?</a><br>

A. God speaks in this way for a good reason. He wants to teach us that the blood and Spirit of Christ remove our sins just as water takes away dirt from the body.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But, even more important, He wants to assure us by this divine pledge and sign that we are as truly cleansed from our sins spiritually as we are bodily washed with water.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. I Cor. 6:11; Rev. 1:5; 7:14. 
2. Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; Rom. 6:3, 4; Gal. 3:27.

<br><a name="Q74" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q74. Should infants, too, be baptized?</a><br>

A. Yes. Infants as well as adults belong to God's covenant and congregation.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Through Christ's blood the redemption from sin and the Holy Spirit, who works faith, are promised to them no less than to adults.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Therefore, by baptism, as sign of the covenant, they must be grafted into the Christian church and distinguished from the children of unbelievers.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> This was done in the old covenant by circumcision,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> in place of which baptism was instituted in the new covenant.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

1. Gen. 17:7; Matt. 19:14. 
2. Ps. 22:11; Is. 44:1-3; Acts 2:38, 39; 16:31. 
3. Acts 10:47; I Cor. 7:14. 
4. Gen. 17:9-14. 
5. Col. 2: 11-13.

<br><a name="Q75" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q75. How does the Lord's Supper signify and seal to you that you share in Christ's one sacrifice on the cross and in all His gifts?</a><br>

A. In this way: Christ has commanded me and all believers to eat of this broken bread and drink of this cup in remembrance of Him. With this command He gave these promises:<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> First, as surely as I see with my eyes the bread of the Lord broken for me and the cup given to me, so surely was His body offered for me and His blood poured out for me on the cross. Second, as surely as I receive from the hand of the minister and taste with my mouth the bread and the cup of the Lord as sure signs of Christ's body and blood, so surely does He Himself nourish and refresh my soul to everlasting life with His crucified body and shed blood.

1. Matt. 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19, 20; I Cor. 11:23-25.

<br><a name="Q76" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q76. What does it mean to eat the crucified body of Christ and to drink His shed blood?</a><br>

A. First, to accept with a believing heart all the suffering and the death of Christ, and so receive forgiveness of sins and life eternal.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Second, to be united more and more to His sacred body through the Holy Spirit, who lives both in Christ and in us.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Therefore, although Christ is in heaven<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and we are on earth, yet we are flesh of His flesh and bone of His bones,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> and we forever live and are governed by one Spirit, as the members of our body are by one soul.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup>

2. John 6:55, 56; I Cor. 12:13.

5. John 6:56-58; 15:1-6; Eph. 4:15, 16; I John 3:24.

<br><a name="Q77" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q77. Where has Christ promised that He will nourish and refresh believers with His body and blood as surely as they eat of this broken bread and drink of this cup?</a><br>

A. In the institution of the Lord's supper: The Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, "This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, "Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me." For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes (I Corinthians 11:23-26). This promise is repeated by Paul where he says: The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread (I Corinthians 10:16, 17).

<br><a name="Q78" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q78. Are then the bread and wine changed into the real body and blood of Christ?</a><br>

A. No. Just as the water of baptism is not changed into the blood of Christ and is not the washing away of sins itself but is simply God's sign and pledge,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> so also the bread in the Lord's supper does not become the body of Christ itself,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> although it is called Christ's body<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> in keeping with the nature and usage of sacraments.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

1. Eph. 5:26; Tit. 3:5. 
2. Matt. 26:26-29. 
3. I Cor. 10:16, 17; 11:26-28. 
4. Gen. 17:10, 11; Ex. 12:11, 13; I Cor. 10:3, 4; I Pet. 3:21.

<br><a name="Q79" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q79. Why then does Christ call the bread His body and the cup His blood, or the new covenant in His blood, and why does Paul speak of a participation in the body and blood of Christ?</a><br>

A. Christ speaks in this way for a good reason: He wants to teach us by His supper that as bread and wine sustain us in this temporal life, so His crucified body and shed blood are true food and drink for our souls to eternal life.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But, even more important, He wants to assure us by this visible sign and pledge, first, that through the working of the Holy Spirit we share in His true body and blood as surely as we receive with our mouth these holy signs in remembrance of Him,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and, second, that all His suffering and obedience are as certainly ours as if we personally had suffered and paid for our sins.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

2. I Cor. 10:16, 17; 11:26. 
3. Rom. 6:5-11.

<br><a name="Q80" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q80. What difference is there between the Lord's supper and the papal mass?</a><br>

A. The Lord's supper testifies to us, first, that we have complete forgiveness of all our sins through the one sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which He Himself accomplished on the cross once for all;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and, second, that through the Holy Spirit we are grafted into Christ,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> who with His true body is now in heaven at the right hand of the Father,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and this is where He wants to be worshipped.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> But the mass teaches, first, that the living and the dead do not have forgiveness of sins through the suffering of Christ unless He is still offered for them daily by the priests; and, second, that Christ is bodily present in the form of bread and wine, and there is to be worshipped. Therefore the mass is basically nothing but a denial of the one sacrifice and suffering of Jesus Christ, and an accursed idolatry.

<br><a name="Q81" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q81. Who are to come to the table of the Lord?</a><br>

A. Those who are truly displeased with themselves because of their sins and yet trust that these are forgiven them and that their remaining weakness is covered by the suffering and death of Christ, and who also desire more and more to strengthen their faith and amend their life. But hypocrites and those who do not repent eat and drink judgment upon themselves.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

1. I Cor. 10:19-22; 11:26-32.

<br><a name="Q82" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q82. Are those also to be admitted to the Lord's supper who by their confession and life show that they are unbelieving and ungodly?</a><br>

A. No, for then the covenant of God would be profaned and His wrath kindled against the whole congregation.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Therefore, according to the command of Christ and His apostles, the Christian church is duty-bound to exclude such persons by the keys of the kingdom of heaven, until they amend their lives.

1. Ps. 50:16; Is. 1:11-17; I Cor. 11:17-34.

<br><a name="Q83" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q83. What are the keys of the kingdom of heaven?</a><br>

A. The preaching of the holy gospel and church discipline. By these two the kingdom of heaven is opened to believers and closed to unbelievers.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

1. Matt. 16:19; John 20:21-23.

<br><a name="Q84" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q84. How is the kingdom of heaven opened and closed by the preaching of the gospel?</a><br>

A. According to the command of Christ, the kingdom of heaven is opened when it is proclaimed and publicly testified to each and every believer that God has really forgiven all their sins for the sake of Christ's merits, as often as they by true faith accept the promise of the gospel. The kingdom of heaven is closed when it is proclaimed and testified to all unbelievers and hypocrites that the wrath of God and eternal condemnation rest on them as long as they do not repent. According to this testimony of the gospel, God will judge both in this life and in the life to come.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

<br><a name="Q85" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q85. How is the kingdom of heaven closed and opened by church discipline?</a><br>

A. According to the command of Christ, people who call themselves Christians but show themselves to be unchristian in doctrine or life are first repeatedly admonished in a brotherly manner. If they do not give up their errors or wickedness, they are reported to the church, that is, to the elders. If they do not heed also their admonitions, they are forbidden the use of the sacraments, and they are excluded by the elders from the Christian congregation, and by God Himself from the kingdom of Christ.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> They are again received as members of Christ and of the church when they promise and show real amendment.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

<br><a name="Q86" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q86. Since we have been delivered from our misery by grace alone through Christ, without any merit of our own, why must we yet do good works?</a><br>

A. Because Christ, having redeemed us by His blood, also renews us by His Holy Spirit to be His image, so that with our whole life we may show ourselves thankful to God for His benefits,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and He may be praised by us.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Further, that we ourselves may be assured of our faith by its fruits,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> and that by our godly walk of life we may win our neighbours for Christ.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

You shall not make for yourself a graven image, 2. or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, 2. or that is in the earth beneath, 2. or that is in the water under the earth; 2. you shall not bow down to them or serve them; 2. for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, 2. visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children 2. to the third and fourth generation 2. of those who hate Me, 2. but showing steadfast love to thousands of those 2. who love Me and keep My commandments. 3. You shall not take the Name of the LORD your God 3. in vain; 3. for the LORD will not hold him guiltless 3. who takes His Name in vain. 4. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 4. Six days you shall labour, and do all your work; 4. but the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your 4. God; 4. in it you shall not do any work, 4. you, or your son, or your daughter, 4. your manservant, or your maidservant, 4. or your cattle, 4. or the sojourner who is within your gates; 4. for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, 4. the sea, and all that is in them, 4. and rested the seventh day; 4. therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day 4. and hallowed it. 5. Honour your father and your mother, 5. that your days may be long 5. in the land which the LORD your God gives you. 6. You shall not kill. 7. You shall not commit adultery. 8. You shall not steal. 9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour. 10. you shall not covet your neighbour's house; 10. you shall not covet your neighbour's wife, 10. or his manservant, or his maidservant, 10. or his ox, or his ass, 10. or anything that is your neighbour's.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

A. Certainly,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> for no sin is greater or provokes God's wrath more than the blaspheming of His Name. That is why He commanded it to be punished with death.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

A. Yes, when the government demands it of its subjects, or when necessity requires it, in order to maintain and promote fidelity and truth, to God's glory and for our neighbour's good. Such oath-taking is based on God's Word<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and was therefore rightly used by saints in the Old and the New Testament.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

A.

<br><a name="Q105" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q105. What does God require in the sixth commandment?</a><br>

A. I am not to dishonour, hate, injure, or kill my neighbour by thoughts, words, or gestures, and much less by deeds, whether personally or through another;<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> rather, I am to put away all desire of revenge.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> Moreover, I am not to harm or recklessly endanger myself.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> Therefore, also, the government bears the sword to prevent murder.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

<br><a name="Q106" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q106. But does this commandment speak only of killing?</a><br>

A. By forbidding murder God teaches us that He hates the root of murder, such as envy, hatred, anger, and desire of revenge,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> and that He regards all these as murder.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

1. Prov. 14:30; Rom. 1:29; 12:19; Gal. 5:19-21; James 1:20; I John 2:9-11.

No. When God condemns envy, hatred, and anger, He commands us to love our neighbour as ourselves,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> to show patience, peace, gentleness, mercy, and friendliness toward him,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> to protect him from harm as much as we can, and to do good even to our enemies.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

<br><a name="Q108" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q108. What does the seventh commandment teach us?</a><br>

A. That all unchastity is cursed by God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> We must therefore detest it from the heart<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> and live chaste and disciplined lives, both within and outside of holy marriage.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup>

<br><a name="Q109" href="#contents" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:Black;">Q109. Does God in this commandment forbid nothing more than adultery and similar shameful sins?</a><br> A. Since we, body and soul, are temples of the Holy Spirit, it is God's will that we keep ourselves pure and holy.

A.

A. I must not give false testimony against anyone, twist no one's words, not gossip or slander, nor condemn or join in condemning anyone rashly and unheard.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Rather, I must avoid all lying and deceit as the devil's own works, under penalty of God's heavy wrath.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> In court and everywhere else, I must love the truth,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> speak and confess it honestly, and do what I can to defend and promote my neighbour's honour and reputation.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup>

A. No. In this life even the holiest have only a small beginning of this obedience.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Nevertheless, with earnest purpose they do begin to live not only according to some but to all the commandments of God.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

A. First, that throughout our life we may more and more become aware of our sinful nature, and therefore seek more eagerly the forgiveness of sins and righteousness in Christ.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> Second, that we may be zealous for good deeds and constantly pray to God for the grace of the Holy Spirit, that He may more and more renew us after God's image, until after this life we reach the goal of perfection.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup>

A.

A. To awaken in us at the very beginning of our prayer that childlike reverence and trust toward God which should be basic to our prayer: God has become our Father through Christ and will much less deny us what we ask of Him in faith than our fathers would refuse us earthly things.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup>

A. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

Wilt Thou, therefore, uphold and strengthen us by the power of Thy Holy Spirit, so that in this spiritual war<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> we may not go down to defeat, but always firmly resist our enemies, until we finally obtain the complete victory.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup>
