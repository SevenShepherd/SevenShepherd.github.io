Salvation is by grace alone and justification in the sight of God is by faith alone. 

> For we hold that one is justified by **faith apart from works** of the law. &mdash; Romans 3:28 ESV (cf. Eph 2:8-10)

Faith is the instrument by which we lay hold of God's grace, faith means to "trust in" God, it is a reliance on him for salvation apart from any works we can do. We cannot merit our salvation.

> Remain in me, and I will remain in you. **Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself**, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me. &mdash; John 15:4

Once a person is saved and justified by this trust/faith, they will receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit the moment they believe (Eph 1:13-14). We learn in both Galatians 5:22-23 and John 15:1-17 that God works these fruits of the faith in us, like obedience (1Jn 2:4), repentance (Lk 13:3) and good works (James 2:14-26) that characterize a Holy Spirit filled individual.

> ‚ÄúYes, I am the vine; you are the branches. **Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit.** For apart from me you can do nothing. &mdash; John 15:5

We're not saved by these fruits, salvation simply produces them post-justification "after we're already saved." That is why I say, obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience.

> **Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me.** And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them.‚Äù &mdash; John 14:21 (cf. Jn 14:15)

<!-- And that is what I and other basic protestants like Chuck Smith, Ron Rhodes, Chuck Missler, and Geisler, Packer, Ryrie, and Grudem all teach. -->

Being a basic or historic protestant makes us a part of the group responsible for the original reformation doctrine of faith alone or sole fide. A faith that results in dispositions of love and Godly character.

> Some people may contradict our teaching, but **these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. These teachings promote a godly life.** 4 Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding... &mdash; 1 Timothy 6:3-4 NLT

By grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to scripture alone, for the glory of God alone. These are known as the [Five Solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg).

This is why we can confidently preach Christ's message of repentance (turning away from sin to God in Mt 4:17; Acts 26:20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5; 3:3) and if you don't repent that you will die (Lk 13:3); and also why we can confidently teach that Christians do not "practice sin" (Ro 6:1-2,15; 1Jn 3:6-10), which means that we do not pursue lifestyles of indulgent sin, because for supernatural reasons we're incapable (1Jn 5:18).

So when Christ says that you can know a true Christian by their fruits he really means it, because if your faith was genuine it would bear these outcomes. **Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically.** The fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23). If the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10).

**So we have learned it is not the fruit that saves, its the salvation the grows the fruit.** If you are saved you will bear fruit (Jn 15:5). This opens up discussions of God's work of regeneration (Jn 3:7), the Holy Spirit's sanctification, and God granted repentance (Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25). This is not your doing it's Gods, so if you're not saved, you won't see these outcomes.

God bless.
