<sup>Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford), On [faith](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo), on [repentance](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8).</sup>

It's by simple observation, that we conclude, that saving faith &ldquo;results&rdquo; in obedience to God, &ldquo;after,&rdquo; we are justified, and that it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo; obedience.

> For we hold that one is justified by **faith apart from works** of the law. &mdash; Romans 3:28 ESV

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">‚ÄúIf you love me,</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will obey my commandments</span>. &mdash; John 14:15 NET

<!-- Repent (turn from your sin) for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand (Ac 3:19; Mt 3:8; 4:17). If you do not wake up you will all perish (Rev 3:3; Lk 13:3).  -->

Repentance ([turning from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/)) does not merit salvation, but a person who loves God will obey his commandment to repent (**Ac 17:30**; 1Jn 2:4). When a Christian does not repent, it brings into serious question, the validity of his faith.

<!-- and I believe, will be enabled to desire to do so. -->

> The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">he commands</span> all people everywhere to <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">repent</span>, &mdash; Acts 17:30 ESV

> Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">his commandments</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">is a liar, and the truth is not in him</span>, &mdash; 1 John 2:4 ESV

Repentance is the fruit of [genuine saving faith](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-results/). Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (John 15:1-17).</span>

## Faith Alone

This does not conflict with *Sola Fide* or &ldquo;Faith Alone&rdquo; because repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith; in fact this is the definition of *sola fide*. Saving faith "results" in (**not** &ldquo;includes&rdquo;) obedience to God (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4) and good works that "follow after" (**not** merits) justification (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). **It's post-justification.** Once you're already saved, someone who was genuine about their faith would desire to repent. This article is teaching dispositions of the heart post-justification.

- üêâ The Serpent says, *&ldquo;Surely you will not die&rdquo;* (Gen. 3:4 NET).
- üçá God says, *&ldquo;No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.&rdquo;* (Luke 13:3 ESV)
- üßë Repentance does not merit salvation, salvation produces repentance.

Repentance, obedience, and good works are all fruits of genuine saving faith. Fruits of already being saved; that's why we say they follow necessarily, because if the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10). I believe that no rational person could ever conclude that repentance is optional after reading the following evidences, and that is because <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#800080;">we don't control the fruit bearing process, <span style="font-size:1.2em;">God does</span></span>.

## Raw Logical Conclusions

This is how the logic looks without any effort to sugarcoat anything.

1. God commands that you repent (Ac 17:30) and those who say they "know God" but don't obey His commandments are liars and not living in the truth (1Jn 2:4).
2. Unless you repent you will die (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3).
3. Those who do not obey God's commandments do not love God (Jn 14:15,21) and God gave us the commandment to repent (Ac 17:30), so those who do not repent do not love God.
4. Those who do not repent do not want their sins forgiven (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10).
5. Those who do not repent do not want to be led to salvation (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18).
6. The consequences of failing to repent are disasterous (Re 2:5,16; 3:3; 16:9)

## How We Should Preach Them

I don't think we should sugarcoat the gospel, but because we cannot see into a person's heart and because our knowledge is not complete as human beings, it's best to teach this as evidence instead of proof. A person could be justified but have zero assurance of salvation.

<!-- The fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23).  -->

1. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** that they do not love God (Ac 17:30; Jn 14:15,21)
2. Those who do not repent will perish (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3 NLT)
3. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of false profession (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4)
4. Those who do not repent have **&ldquo;given strong evidence&rdquo;** of not being led to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18)
5. Faith that does not &ldquo;result&rdquo; in repentance is not a faith (Jas 2:19) that leads to salvation (2Cor. 7:10). It is a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#living">dead faith</a>.
6. Why did Jesus come? (Lk 5:32)

## Genuine faith always results in repentance.

Saving faith **does not include** obedience, saving faith **results in** obedience. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts but instead a trust and reliance in Christ. Genuine saving faith will always be accompanied by good works that come **after justification**. Good works and continuing to believe **follow** saving faith (*sola fide*).

- Repentance is **a turning away from sin to God** in trust (Acts 26:18,20; 3:19; Mt 3:8 NLT; Rev 2:5), as [**every authoritative Greek lexicon reveals**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/).
    - This is a summary of the Apostle Paul's obedience to Jesus' command to open the eyes of the gentiles so that they may **turn from darkness to light** (Acts 26:18,20).
- Repentance is produced from **a Godly sorrow** and **leads to salvation and eternal life** (2 Cor. 7:10; Acts 11:18).
- Repentance is necessary (Lk 13:3) **for the forgiveness of sins** (Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31).
- Unrepentant sinners will perish (Luke 13:3; Mt 3:10).
- Repentance is a command from God himself (Acts 17:30; Mt 4:17).
- While there may be an initial saving repentance, it is not a one time event (Luke 17:3-4; 1 Cor. 5:12-13 NLT).
- The meaning of repentance in the new testament is the same in the old testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
- Repentance is an immediate fruit of genuine saving faith **resulting in good works and righteous behavior** (Mt 3:8 NLT; Ac 26:20; Rev 2:5)

<!-- > "Faith that does not involve repentance is not true faith. It is not a faith that leads to salvation." &mdash; AMG Concise -->

<!-- Faith that does not &ldquo;result&rdquo; in repentance is not a faith (Jas 2:19) that leads to salvation, It is a <a href="https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#living">dead faith</a>. Think about 2Cor. 7:10, when its says the repentance leads to salvation... are you saved? Then at some point to will have turned from your sins which would have been produced by a Godly contrition. Why did Jesus come? (Lk 5:32) -->

If the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10; James 2:14-26). This is the raw logical conclusion.

<!-- It could also mean that you're a very infantile Christian undergoing the initial stages of sanctification, maybe you lerned of God yesterday. -->

<!-- 5. The consequences of failing to repent are disasterous (Re 2:5,16; 3:3; 16:9) -->

<!-- 3. Those who do not repent are unforgiven? (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10) -->
