It's by simple observation, that we conclude, that saving faith &ldquo;results&rdquo; in obedience to God, &ldquo;after,&rdquo; we are justified, and that it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo; obedience.

> For we hold that one is justified by **faith apart from works** of the law. &mdash; Romans 3:28 ESV

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">‚ÄúIf you love me,</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will obey my commandments</span>. &mdash; John 14:15 NET

Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand (Ac 3:19; Mt 3:8; 4:17). If you do not wake up you will all perish (Rev 3:3; Lk 13:3). Repentance does not merit salvation, but a person who loves God will obey his commandment to repent (**Ac 17:30**; 1Jn 2:4), and I believe, will be enabled to desire to do so. When a Christian does not repent, it brings into serious question, the validity of his faith.

> Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep his commandments **is a liar, and the truth is not in him**, &mdash; 1 John 2:4 ESV
