It's by simple observation, that we conclude, that saving faith &ldquo;results&rdquo; in obedience to God, &ldquo;after,&rdquo; we are justified, and that it does not &ldquo;include&rdquo; obedience.

> For we hold that one is justified by **faith apart from works** of the law. &mdash; Romans 3:28 ESV

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">‚ÄúIf you love me,</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will obey my commandments</span>. &mdash; John 14:15 NET

<!-- Repent (turn from your sin) for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand (Ac 3:19; Mt 3:8; 4:17). If you do not wake up you will all perish (Rev 3:3; Lk 13:3).  -->

Repentance ([turning from sin](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repentance/)) does not merit salvation, but a person who loves God will obey his commandment to repent (**Ac 17:30**; 1Jn 2:4). When a Christian does not repent, it brings into serious question, the validity of his faith.

<!-- and I believe, will be enabled to desire to do so. -->

> Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep his commandments **is a liar, and the truth is not in him**, &mdash; 1 John 2:4 ESV

Repentance is the fruit of [Genuine saving faith](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-results/). Bearing Fruit Happens Naturally For Living Trees. A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (John 15:1-17).

<!-- The fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23).  -->

1. Those who do not desire to repent do not love God (Ac 17:30; Jn 14:15,21)
2. Those who do not desire to repent will die (Lk 13:3; Mt 18:3 NLT)
3. Those who do not desire to repent are liars not living in the truth (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4) 
4. Those who do not desire to repent are not led to salvation and eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; Ac 11:18)

If the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10; James 2:14-26). This is the raw logical conclusion.

<!-- It could also mean that you're a very infantile Christian undergoing the initial stages of sanctification, maybe you lerned of God yesterday. -->

<!-- 5. The consequences of failing to repent are disasterous (Re 2:5,16; 3:3; 16:9) -->

<!-- 3. Those who do not repent are unforgiven? (Luke 24:47; Acts 3:19,26; 5:31; 17:30; 2 Cor. 7:10) -->
