<a name="practice" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">I. True Christians Do Not Practice Sin</a>

Practice in this sense means a lifelong continual pattern<sup><a href="#esvsb_cite">1</a></sup>, a lifestyle of indulgent sin. This is contrasted with struggling with sin, backsliding, and making mistakes. A true Christian will undergo decreasing patterns of sin (1 John 3:8–9; cf. Rom. 6:14–18) in their progressive sanctification. They will not remain in their old way of life (2 Cor. 5:17), they will not wallow around in sin (Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; Heb. 10:26-31; 1Jn 2:3-6, 3:8-10). Fact.

> &ldquo;*the faith that justifies, Luther said, is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.*&rdquo; &mdash; [**Dr. R. C. Sproul**](hhttps://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q?t=703) (Ph.D., Whitefield Theological Seminary)

When the academic community, the exegetes, the textual critics, the research professors, and all other scholars say that true saving faith always or naturally **results** in obedience to God and good works that follow **after** justification, they are not saying that justification includes works, because that would be the heresy of legalism. What they are saying is that you will not have a dead faith, they are defending you from [the heresy antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/antinomian-heresy/) among other heresies.

> Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague &mdash; [**Dr. J. I. Packer**](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8) (Ph.D., University of Oxford) [Concise Theology. Chapter 65 Legalism. p. 191.](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A)

<!-- > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed: to destroy the works of the devil. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> Everyone who has been fathered by God does not practice sin, because God’s seed resides in him, and thus he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> By this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed: Everyone who does not practice righteousness—the one who does not love his fellow Christian—is not of God. &mdash; 1 Jn 3:8-10 NET -->

<a name="studies" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.1.1 Study Bibles</a>

    > **3:6–7** No one who abides … keeps on sinning. True followers of Christ do not recklessly and habitually violate what their anointing (2:20, 27) has planted within them (see note on 3:9–10). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Those who do habitually sin have neither seen him nor known him. They are <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not genuine Christians</span>.</span> On “abides,” see also notes on John 8:31; 15:4.

    > **3:8** The reason the Son of God appeared restates v. 5 but here specifies the connection of sin to the devil. Knowing Christ means becoming involved in an all-out war against the works of the devil, that is, the practice of sinning.

    > **3:9-10** ... In other words, because the Word is present in the believer’s heart through the work of the Spirit, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">the believer <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">cannot</span> keep on sinning. Thus the hearts of <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">genuine Christians</span> (those who are truly children of God) have been so transformed that they cannot live in a pattern of continual sin</span>—though this does not mean that Christians are ever completely free from sin in this life (see 1 John 1:8–10). By this it is evident. Or, as Jesus said of false prophets, *“You will recognize them by their fruits”* (Matt. 7:16).

    > I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that **faith alone is what saves us, not faith plus obedience**. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD)

    In the 14th verse of the 2nd chapter of the book of James in the Bible, we find that if a person has no good works, and that if there is no change in his life, then that person has a ***"dead faith"***&mdash;and verse 14 implies that that kind of faith cannot save a person. 

    > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if **someone** says he has faith but does not have works? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Can that faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">save him</span>?</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> So also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">faith by itself, if it does not have works, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:14-17 ESV

    >> It's important to recognize that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">these warnings were written not to people <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">outside the church</span></span> but to people who would be listening to the New Testament epistles as they were read aloud in New Testament Churches (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11; 2 Cor. 13:5; Heb. 3:12; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 3:6, 9-10; 14) &mdash; Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D., Westminster Theological Seminary), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). pp. 79-82.
    
    Pay attention to the context of whom James is speaking; James is not talking about all of his readers or even most of his readers, he is talking about *"someone"* which is distinguished from *"my brothers."* James continues speaking in context to eternal salvation.

    >> In addition, <span style="color:#A8A8A8">[critics]</span> fail to consider that <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">whenever the Greek word sózó&mdash;&ldquo;save,deliver&rdquo;&mdash;is used in the New Testament, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">it always refers to eternal salvation</span></span> except where the context specifies of a situation of rescue from physical danger or healing from physical sickness (as in James 5:15 or Matt. 8:25; 9:22, for example). But there is no such contextual specification in James 2:14-17. Therefore we are correct to understand it as referring to eternal salvation, which is consistent with its usage in every other New Testament context ...  &mdash; Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D., Westminster Theological Seminary), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). pp. 132-134.

    > <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">faith apart from works <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:20,24,26 ESV
    >> This same consideration regarding the use of the Greek term sózó also weighs heavily against <span style="color:#A8A8A8">[critics]</span> interpretation of <span style="color:#A8A8A8">[James 2:26]</span> &mdash; Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., Cambridge; D.D., Westminster Theological Seminary), ["Free Grace" Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel](https://amzn.to/3k3gESD). pp. 132-136.

    The context shows that James was referring to showing one’s faith through doing good deeds. This is not to be confused with Paul (Rom 3:20, 28; Gal 2:16; 3:10–12) when he was referring to “works” (erga) of Jewish law.<sup><a href="#logos_cite">4</a></sup>

- <a name="packer" href="#packer_cite" style="font-size:1.4em;">1.1.2.2 Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford)</a>

    > **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.** Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‘faith apart from observing the law’, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">if ‘good works’ (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith</span>, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">justifying faith (fiducia) is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not yet ours</span></span>. &mdash; [Concise Theology. Chapter 59 Works. p. 174.](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A)

- <a name="carson" href="#carson_cite" style="font-size:1.4em;">1.1.2.3 Dr. D. A. Carson (Ph.D., University of Cambridge)</a>

    > <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/course/justification-faith-biblical-theological-perspective/#what-is-faith" style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">Faith Is More than Belief</a>
    >
    But in the second place, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">faith is more than simply believing that certain things are true</span>. James has something to say about this in the second chapter of his epistle. He says, <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:red;">“Faith without works is dead.”</span> In fact, a few months ago, I was in Sweden debating with a Catholic theologian who said, “I don’t understand you Christians who call yourselves evangelicals.” He says, “You speak of being saved by faith alone, whereas James explicitly says that ‘Faith without works is dead.’ Faith, all by itself, faith alone, is precisely what’s invalid. How do you respond to that?” My response is pretty straightforward. **The kind of faith that James is talking about is not the kind of faith that Paul is talking about.** They use the same word in different ways, which often happens in the New Testament.
    >
    Let me give you another example so you see I’m not making things up. When Paul says that Christians are “called of God,” for example, for him, the call of God is effectual; it works. If you’re called of God, you really are saved. Whereas, in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), the call of God is something like the invitation of God: “Many are called, but few are chosen.” So in other words, the word “call” can mean slightly different things depending on the writer, depending on the context. That often happens. It’s because God has chosen to give His infallible Word through different human functionaries, through human authors.
    >
    So how does “faith” mean something different in James than in Paul? Well, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">James makes it very clear. He says, “Consider the demons. They believe there is one God.” In fact, he says, “You believe there is one God; you’re doing well. But then <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">so do the demons, and it doesn’t save them, so why should it save you?</span>” Satan himself believes that Jesus rose from the dead; he believes in the resurrection, but it doesn’t save him. In other words, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">merely believing the truth that Christ rose from the dead is not salvific</span>; it’s not saving; it’s not transforming.</span>
    >
    > <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/course/justification-faith-biblical-theological-perspective/#what-is-faith" style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">Faith Includes Trust</a>
    >
    There is another element: faith, though it is based on the truth or on the promises and words of Him who is the truth, faith also involves self-abandonment to that truth or to the God who speaks the truth. It involves our trust in Him. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Satan believes that Jesus rose from the dead; Satan never trusts Christ. Satan believes that there is one God; he doesn’t abandon himself to God. Genuine saving faith is not to be confused with works, but it is of a different quality than mere belief in propositions.</span> The propositions must be true (that’s the first point), but in the second place, there must be a self-abandonment to God.
    >
    It has a kind of repentance built into it. It’s the very nature of faith to abandon myself to God and His word and His promises, or it’s not saving faith. So when Paul says to the Philippian jailer, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved,” he certainly means something more than “Believe that Jesus rose from the dead, and you will be saved.” <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">That you might almost call “demonic faith”; that is to say, it’s faith that a demon can exercise without it saving anybody, whereas genuine saving faith not only believes the truth that God has revealed, but also it finds the believer abandoning himself</span>, abandoning herself, to Christ in wonderful trust.

We will occasionally fall into sin, but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">the one who is living a life, a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">lifestyle</span>, of continually sinning has never been born again.</span> So it doesn't matter how many times you've walked an aisle, doesn't matter how many times you've prayed a prayer with a counselor, it doesn't matter how many times you've joined a church, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">if your life doesn't match up with your profession of faith it calls into serious account the validity of your profession of faith in christ.</span> So to put it another way wherever there is the root of the new birth <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">there will always be the fruit of a changed life</span> and even Jesus said in matthew 7 verse 20 you will know them by their fruit you can know what's going on beneath the surface down in the ground where the root is by just examining the fruit and so that's the whole argument that John is making here. To put it another way, there is an inseparable connection between regeneration and sanctification, regeneration will always be evidenced in sanctification, which is a progressive growth into christ's likeness. &mdash; [Dr. Steven J. Lawson](https://www.youtube.com/live/YYTF8cTETzc?feature=share&t=628)

    > 1 John 3:9 John affirmed that “no one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.” <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color:orangered;">This confirms</span> moderate <span style="color:orangered;">Calvinism</span>’s</span> view of eternal security for two reasons. First, anyone truly born of God cannot persist in evil. **If someone does, then he is not born of God.** That is, a Christian’s perseverance in avoiding continual, habitual sin is a proof of his salvation &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Systematic Theology Vol. 3 Sin & Salvation. Ch. 11.

    > As Ryrie put it, "**Saving faith is a working faith**, and those works justify believers in the courtroom on earth," and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">an "unproductive faith is a spurious faith."</span> &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Four Views On Eternal Security. p. 107. <sup style="color:#A8A8A8;"><sup>45</sup>Ryrie, So GreatSalvation, 110-11.</sup>

    > As Charles Ryrie correctly observed, <span style="font-weight:bold;">"every Christian will bear fruit; <span style="color:orangered;">otherwise he or she is not a true believer."</span></span> For 'fruit, then, furnishes evidence of saving faith. The evidence may be strong or weak, erratic or regular, visible or not. But a **saving faith works**," &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Four Views On Eternal Security. p. 105.

    > Since saving faith is an act of trust in and obedience to Jesus Christ regarding the gospel, it is evident from its very essence that **saving faith (which <span style="color:orangered;">involves repentance</span>) will naturally tend to produce good works**—a nominal, noncommittal, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">purely intellectual-type faith will not</span>. Therefore, whereas <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">we are saved by faith alone, saving faith is not alone</span> but is inclined to produce good works. &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler

    The following is an excerpt from Chuck Smith's C2000. We also recommend his topical study on [repentance](https://youtu.be/kP8rIIps4Sk?t=130).

    > 1Jn 3:6 Whosoever abides in him does not **practice** sin: and whosoever **practices** sin has not seen him, neither known him. Pretty powerful words. It should cause us to examine our own lives. **If I am living a life of practicing sin, I really don’t know Him. I really haven’t seen Him. If I really know Him, then I’m gonna be free from the practice of sin.**

    > 1Jn 3:8 **He that is practicing sin is of the devil**; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. So again, don’t deceive yourself. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">If you are <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">practicing</span> sin, living in sin, you are not of God; you are a part of that rebellion against God, led by Satan.</span>

- <a name="graham" href="#graham_cite" style="font-size:1.4em;">1.1.3.2 Billy Graham</a>

    > Ask God to reveal the hypocrisy in your life&mdash;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">an inconsistency between what you profess and what you <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">practice</span></span>. Then ask God to bring you so close to Christ that you won't have any desire to live an inconsistent, deceitful life. &mdash; Billy Graham
