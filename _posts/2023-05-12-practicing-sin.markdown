I've complied a list of some of the most sound spiritual leaders for Christ as well as the most highly educated minds in theology and science, to prove once and for all the simple and natural reading of the Bible, that Christians do not "practice" sin (1 Jn 3:6-10,31; 5:18; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6), abuse grace as a license to sin (Jd 4 NET), or remain in a lifestyle of sin (Ro 6:1-2,15; Gal 5:19-21). If they do, they give strong evidence of false profession (1Jn 2:4; Mt 10:38; Mt 18:3 NLT; Lk 9:23,62).

- 🐉 The Serpent says, *&ldquo;Surely you will not die&rdquo;* (Gen. 3:4 NET).
- 🍇 God says, *&ldquo;Little children, let no one deceive you. ... Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, ... No one born of God makes a practice of sinning ...&rdquo;* (1 John 3:7-9 ESV)
- 🧑 Obedience does not merit salvation, salvation produces obedience.

Practice in this sense means a lifelong continual pattern. It speaks of the pursuit of a lifestyle of indulgent sin. This does not mean that you will not have sin or that you will be perfect, in fact you may struggle with sin, make mistakes, and even backslide. A true Christian will undergo decreasing patterns of sin (1 John 3:8–9; cf. Rom. 6:14–18) in their progressive sanctification. They will not remain in their old way of life (2 Cor. 5:17; 1Jn 3:31).

Whoever makes a practice of sinning <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is of the devil</span>, ... <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">No one born of God</span> makes a practice of sinning ...</span> &mdash; 1 John 3:7-9 ESV

I've written this article because certain modern theologies falsely teach grace as a license to sin (Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; Heb. 10:26-31; 1Jn 2:3-6, 3:8-10). This is the same deception that Satan used in the garden of eden when he deceived our parents (Adam & Eve). It reflects the lie that the Serpent spewed, *&ldquo;Surely you will not die&rdquo;* (Gen. 3:4 NET). I'm writing this article to protect the children from this demonic teaching.

> **It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea** <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">than that he should <span style="font-size:1.3em;color:red;">cause</span> one of these little ones <span style="font-size:1.3em;color:red;">to sin</span></span>. &mdash; Luke 17:2 (cf. 1Jn 3:7-9)

We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/). [Sola fide](/assets/images/solas.jpg). If you do not obey God's commandments, not only are you showing evidence that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but you're also showing evidence that your profession of faith is false (1Jn 2:3-6). Make sure your heart has not betrayed you (Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9), examine your faith to see if it is genuine (2Cor. 13:5 NLT).

> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">The old has passed away;</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">behold, the new has come.</span> &mdash; 2 Corinthians 5:17 ESV

Repentance, obedience, and good works are all fruits of genuine saving faith. Fruits of already being saved; that's why we say they're not optional, because if the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10).

I've complied a list of some of the most spiritual leaders for Christ as well as the most highly educated minds in theology and science, to prove once and for all the simple and natural reading of the Bible, that Christians do not "practice" sin (1 Jn 3:6-10,31; 5:18; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6), abuse grace as a license to sin (Jd 4 NET), or remain in a lifestyle of sin (Ro 6:1-2,15; Gal 5:19-21). If they do, they give strong evidence of false profession if not outright prove by scripture that they are liars (1Jn 2:4; Mt 10:38; Mt 18:3 NLT; Lk 9:23,62).

> **It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea** <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">than that he should <span style="font-size:1.3em;color:red;">cause</span> one of these little ones <span style="font-size:1.3em;color:red;">to sin</span></span>. &mdash; Luke 17:2 (cf. 1Jn 3:7-9)

The Serpent has been hard at work cleverly disguising his same words of deception that destroyed our parents (Adam & Eve). Modern theologies reflect the lie the serpent spewed, <span style="font-style:italic;">&ldquo;Surely you will not die&rdquo;</span> (Gen. 3:4 NET) by falsely teaching grace as a license to sin (Jd 4 NET).

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Little children, let no one deceive you. ... Whoever makes a practice of sinning <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">is of the devil</span>, ... <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">No one born of God</span> makes a practice of sinning ...</span> &mdash; 1 John 3:7-9 ESV

Practice in this sense means a lifelong continual pattern<sup><a href="#esvsb_cite">1</a></sup>, a lifestyle of indulgent sin. This is contrasted with struggling against sin, backsliding, and making mistakes. A true Christian will undergo decreasing patterns of sin (1 John 3:8–9; cf. Rom. 6:14–18) in their progressive sanctification. They will not remain in their old way of life (2 Cor. 5:17), they will not wallow around in sin (Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; Heb. 10:26-31; 1Jn 2:3-6, 3:8-10). Fact.

> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">The old has passed away;</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">behold, the new has come.</span> &mdash; 2 Corinthians 5:17 ESV

We're saved by grace through faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9), but if you do not obey God's commandments, not only are you showing evidence that you do not love God (Jn 14:15,21), but you're also showing evidence that your profession of faith is false (1Jn 2:3-6).

> &ldquo;*the faith that justifies, Luther said, is a fides viva, a living faith, a faith that is alive and you know it is alive when it manifests itself in the fruit of obedience.*&rdquo; &mdash; [**Dr. R. C. Sproul**](hhttps://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q?t=703) (Ph.D., Whitefield Theological Seminary)

When the academic community, the exegetes, the textual critics, the research professors, and all other scholars say that true saving faith always or naturally **results** in obedience to God and good works that follow **after** justification, they are not saying that justification includes works, because that would be the heresy of legalism. What they are saying is that you will not have a dead faith, they are defending you from [the heresy antinomianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/antinomian-heresy/) among other heresies.

> Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague &mdash; [**Dr. J. I. Packer**](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8) (Ph.D., University of Oxford) [Concise Theology. Chapter 65 Legalism. p. 191.](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A)

    > **3:6–7** No one who abides … keeps on sinning. True followers of Christ do not recklessly and habitually violate what their anointing (2:20, 27) has planted within them (see note on 3:9–10). <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Those who do habitually sin have neither seen him nor known him. They are <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not genuine Christians</span>.</span> On “abides,” see also notes on John 8:31; 15:4.

    > **3:8** The reason the Son of God appeared restates v. 5 but here specifies the connection of sin to the devil. Knowing Christ means becoming involved in an all-out war against the works of the devil, that is, the practice of sinning.

    > **3:9-10** ... In other words, because the Word is present in the believer’s heart through the work of the Spirit, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">the believer <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">cannot</span> keep on sinning. Thus the hearts of <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">genuine Christians</span> (those who are truly children of God) have been so transformed that they cannot live in a pattern of continual sin</span>—though this does not mean that Christians are ever completely free from sin in this life (see 1 John 1:8–10). By this it is evident. Or, as Jesus said of false prophets, *“You will recognize them by their fruits”* (Matt. 7:16).

    > According to the Oxford English Dictionary the word “faith” derives from the Latin fides (from which we get “fidelity”), so its basic meaning is “trust” or “reliance”. The Greek etymological equivalent is pistis, which is found in the New Testament where it has the following principal senses:
    >
    1. belief, trust;
    2. that which produces belief, evidence, token, pledge, engagement;
    3. trust in its objective aspect, troth, observance of trust, fidelity.
    >
    So the main dictionary meanings given to “faith” are: belief, trust, confidence, reliance, and belief proceeding from testimony or authority. It is to be strongly affirmed that the faith in God described in the Bible is “reliance and belief proceeding from testimony or authority”. **Biblical faith is evidence-based.** &mdash; &ldquo;[*Determined to Believe?*]()&rdquo; p. 136.

    --

    > **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing. One of its evidences is a deepening commitment to the word of Christ. A disciple is a learner. The hallmark of a true disciple is a readiness to learn more and more of the truth, thereby discovering that knowledge of truth leads to freedom. Genuine faith perseveres. &mdash; &ldquo;[*Determined to Believe?*]()&rdquo;, On John 8:31–47. p. 218.

    --

    > A second way of knowing that we have eternal life is **by observing the spiritual and moral outworking of our faith in our behaviour**:
    >> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. The man who says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. (1 John 2:3–4.)
    >
    >>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death. (1 John 3:14.)
    >
    Jesus made a similar point when he said, **by their fruit you will recognise them (Matthew 7:20)**. **If there is no moral consistency between our lives and our professed belief in God, then our claim to know God will not be credible.** It is in this context that Peter exhorts his readers to make your calling and election sure by our development of Christian character and moral virtues. The phrase “making sure” means “confirming”. That is, the development of visible Christian moral virtues in **a person’s life confirms the genuineness of their claim to be believers. True faith in God will be evidenced by its moral consequences in the life of a believer.** &mdash; &ldquo;[*Determined to Believe?*]()&rdquo; p. 313.

    > Let us see what John has to say about them. So serious is their heresy that John calls them antichrists and says: 
    >> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. (1 John 2:19 ESV.) 
    > 
    These people departed in two senses: theologically, they abandoned the true doctrines about Christ; and physically, they left the church community. What did that mean in terms of their spiritual state? John says that their action showed that they were not of us, that is, they never had been genuine believers. If they had been, he adds, they would have stayed; but they left, and that demonstrates that they were not genuine, even though to all appearances they had been. Recall the final part of the parable of the sower:
    >> But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. (Luke 8:15.)
    > 
    The heretical teachers didn’t endure. They had no root. In the end they proved themselves to be unbelievers. John backs this up later in his letter by saying:
    >> No-one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No-one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him. Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. Th e reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work. No-one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God. Th is is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother. (1 John 3:6–10.) 
    > 
    Observe the strong emphasis on the present continuous tense: keeps on sinning. John is not saying that genuine believers cannot sometime act inconsistently, or even give in to temptation. Early on in his letter he makes clear that this is possible and that God has made gracious and merciful provision for it.
    >> My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but for the sins of the whole world. (1 John 2:1–2 ESV.)

    > Christian theologians have never seen faith simply in terms of intellectual assent to Christian belief. It is a matter of the heart, not simply the mind, involving personal commitment. As the English theologian William Temple (1881–1944) once pointed out: **“Faith is not only the assent of our minds to doctrinal propositions: it is the commitment of our whole selves into the hands of a faithful Creator and merciful Redeemer.”** &mdash; Dr. Alister McGrath (PhD, DD, DLitt), Theology - The Basics, Faith. p. 1.

    Pay attention to the context of whom James is speaking; James is not talking about all of his readers or even most of his readers, he is talking about *"someone"* which is distinguished from *"my brothers."* James continues speaking in context to eternal salvation.

    The context shows that James was referring to showing one’s faith through doing good deeds. This is not to be confused with Paul (Rom 3:20, 28; Gal 2:16; 3:10–12) when he was referring to “works” (erga) of Jewish law.<sup><a href="#logos_cite">4</a></sup>

- <a name="packer" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.4em;">5.2 Dr. J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford)</a>

    Saving faith is composed of three essential elements: notitia, assensus, and fiducia. As Packer points out in Concise Theology: "Without fiducia there is no faith, but without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14)." 
    
    The latin term notitia means 'knowledge' and refers to an "acquaintance with the content of the gospel"; assensus or ‘agreement’ means "recognition that the gospel is true"; fiducia means ‘trust and reliance’ and it speaks of the "personal dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one’s own righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3."

    > **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism.** Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‘faith apart from observing the law’, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are. But <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">if ‘good works’ (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith</span>, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">justifying faith (fiducia) is <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">not yet ours</span></span>. &mdash; [Concise Theology.

    >
    But in the second place, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">faith is more than simply believing that certain things are true</span>. James has something to say about this in the second chapter of his epistle. He says, <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;color:red;">“Faith without works is dead.”</span> In fact, a few months ago, I was in Sweden debating with a Catholic theologian who said, “I don’t understand you Christians who call yourselves evangelicals.” He says, “You speak of being saved by faith alone, whereas James explicitly says that ‘Faith without works is dead.’ Faith, all by itself, faith alone, is precisely what’s invalid. How do you respond to that?” My response is pretty straightforward. **The kind of faith that James is talking about is not the kind of faith that Paul is talking about.** They use the same word in different ways, which often happens in the New Testament.
    >
    Let me give you another example so you see I’m not making things up. When Paul says that Christians are “called of God,” for example, for him, the call of God is effectual; it works. If you’re called of God, you really are saved. Whereas, in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), the call of God is something like the invitation of God: “Many are called, but few are chosen.” So in other words, the word “call” can mean slightly different things depending on the writer, depending on the context. That often happens. It’s because God has chosen to give His infallible Word through different human functionaries, through human authors.
    >
    So how does “faith” mean something different in James than in Paul? Well, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">James makes it very clear. He says, “Consider the demons. They believe there is one God.” In fact, he says, “You believe there is one God; you’re doing well. But then <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">so do the demons, and it doesn’t save them, so why should it save you?</span>” Satan himself believes that Jesus rose from the dead; he believes in the resurrection, but it doesn’t save him. In other words, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red;">merely believing the truth that Christ rose from the dead is not salvific</span>; it’s not saving; it’s not transforming.</span>
    >
    > <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/course/justification-faith-biblical-theological-perspective/#what-is-faith" style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">Faith Includes Trust</a>
    >
    There is another element: faith, though it is based on the truth or on the promises and words of Him who is the truth, faith also involves self-abandonment to that truth or to the God who speaks the truth. It involves our trust in Him. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">Satan believes that Jesus rose from the dead; Satan never trusts Christ. Satan believes that there is one God; he doesn’t abandon himself to God. Genuine saving faith is not to be confused with works, but it is of a different quality than mere belief in propositions.</span> The propositions must be true (that’s the first point), but in the second place, there must be a self-abandonment to God.
    >
    It has a kind of repentance built into it. It’s the very nature of faith to abandon myself to God and His word and His promises, or it’s not saving faith. So when Paul says to the Philippian jailer, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved,” he certainly means something more than “Believe that Jesus rose from the dead, and you will be saved.” <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">That you might almost call “demonic faith”; that is to say, it’s faith that a demon can exercise without it saving anybody, whereas genuine saving faith not only believes the truth that God has revealed, but also it finds the believer abandoning himself</span>, abandoning herself, to Christ in wonderful trust.
