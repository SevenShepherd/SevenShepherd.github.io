<!-- You May Awaken As I Did (Lk 24:45). There Is A Distinction Between Knowing The Path (Jas 2:19) And Walking The Path (Jas 1:22) -->

<!-- Your Mind May Be Opened Just As Mine Has (Lk 24:45). You'll Begin To Realize That There Is A Distinction Between Knowing The Path (Jas 2:19) And Walking The Path (Jas 1:22) -->

♻️ Many cannot understand the scriptures because they're spiritually discerned (1Cor 2:14). Simple things like God's work of regeneration (Godly dispositions), repentance (resolve to turn from sin), and sanctification (decreasing patterns of sin), will look more like works to them because they do not understand the supernatural angle.

<!-- others because they would rather listen to charlatans (Jer 17:5 NET; Mt 23:10 NLT) than read the Bible -->

<!-- someone foreknown delineates them to you, and even then you will not receive simple things like God's work of regeneration, sanctification, and repentance. -->

> Then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures, &mdash; Luke 24:45 NET (cf. 1 Cor 2:14; Jn 17:9).
>> 
But people who aren’t spiritual can’t receive these truths from God’s Spirit. It all sounds foolish to them and they can’t understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means. &mdash; 1 Corinthians 2:14 NLT

♻️ **Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees.** The fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23). If the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10; James 2:14-26).

<!-- Those who are spiritually discerned won't be able to understand the message of the fruit of the Holy Spirit. They will confuse it for works when the person bearing fruit is doing do because they are a living tree. -->

> But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves. &mdash; James 1:22 (cf. 1Jn 2:4; 3:9)

<!-- In Time You'll Come To Understand The Revelation As I Have. There Exists A Distinction between knowing the path and walking it. -->

♻️ Create in me a clean heart, not I. **You don't God does.**

> Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. &mdash; Psalm 51:10 ESV

<!-- He doesn't say it with his lips necessarily, he could be saying it only with his heart  -->

♻️ One could conceivably profess Christ but have an evil unbelieving heart (Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9), one thing is clear, *&ldquo;they do&rdquo;* practice sin. You shall know them by their fruits (1Jn 3:10 NLT; Mt 7:16).

> Only fools say **in their hearts**, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and **their actions are evil**; not one of them does good! &mdash; Psalm 14:1 NLT (cf. Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9)

<!-- > The fool says **in his heart**, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, **they do** abominable deeds; there is none who does good. &mdash; Psalm 14:1 ESV (cf. Heb 3:12; Jer 17:9) -->

♻️ Only those who do the will of the Father shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven (Mt 7:21). You obey God's will out of love not merit (Jn 14:15,21), it's not a burden because you're chosen (1Jn 5:3-4), it's not your work, it's his in you. It does not conflict with *sola fide*. 

<!-- This error in understanding comes from a lack of wisdom surrounding God's work of regeneration, the Holy Spirit's sanctification, and God granted repentance (Ac 11:18; 2Tim. 2:25). -->

<!-- repentance, obedience, and good works are all fruits of genuine saving faith. Fruits of already being saved; that's why we say they're not optional, because if the fruit isn't growing, the root is dead (Mt 3:10). -->

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ <span style="color:#009933;">will enter the kingdom of heaven</span>, but <span style="color:#009933;">the one who does the will of my Father</span> who is in heaven. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord,</span> <span style="color:orangered;">did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?</span>’ <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">And then will I declare to them, ‘I never [knew](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#foreknew) you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:21-23

♻️ Christians do not practice sin because we're supernaturally preserved and protected from doing so. It is not our work but his.

> We know that everyone fathered by God does not sin, but **God protects the one he has fathered, and the evil one cannot touch him**. &mdash; 1 John 5:18 NET

<!-- > We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. &mdash; 1 John 5:18 ESV -->

<!-- > We know that God’s children do not make a practice of sinning, for God’s Son holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them. &mdash; 1 John 5:18 NLT -->

♻️ If repentance were a meritorious work, Christ would not have commanded it. Repent or perish (Lk 13:3).

> &ldquo;The times of **ignorance** God overlooked, but now <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">he commands</span> all people everywhere to **repent**,&rdquo; &mdash; Acts 17:30 ESV (cf. Jn 14:15, 21; 1Jn 2:4)

<!-- > <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">“If you love me,</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:red;">you will obey my commandments</span>. &mdash; John 14:15 NET -->

<!-- > &ldquo;If someone claims, “I know God,” **but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">doesn’t obey God’s commandments</span>**, that person is a <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">liar</span> and is <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">not living in the truth</span>.&rdquo; &mdash; 1Jn 2:4 NLT (cf. Jn 14:15,21) -->

♻️ They will read about being saved by grace through faith out of context, and create for themselves an antinomian falsehood of assent instead of trust, fall into disobedience, and try to normalize this new unbiblical lifestyle. **They will not be able to understand how Eph 2:8-9 works perfectly with James 2:24.**

> <sup style="font-weight:bold">8</sup> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, <sup style="font-weight:bold">9</sup> not a result of works, so that no one may boast. **<sup>10</sup> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.**

In verses where the Apostle Paul is teaching that we’re no longer under the law of moses (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), he is teaching that justification in the sight of God is by faith only; whereas, James in James 2:24 is speaking of Justification in the sight of men. Good works follow genuine saving faith, they don't merit salvation. If they aren't there you're dead at the same time, because again it's God's work (John 15:1-17).

> ... As the **branch cannot bear fruit by itself**, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. ...

♻️ You **MUST** be born again. Do you abide on the vine? Are you listening?

> Do not marvel that I said to you, **‘You must be born again.’** &mdash; John 3:7 ESV (cf. 2 Cor 5:17)
>> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">The old has passed away;</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">behold, the new has come.</span> &mdash; 2 Corinthians 5:17 ESV
