<!-- "‚õ™ Legalism And Antinomianism Are Two Sides Of The Same Heretical Coin" -->

The fruits of the faith are not the efforts of man, they're the workings of God (1Cor.3:6-7; Jn 15:4; Ga 5:22-23) upon closer union with Christ. Fruit-bearing is anti-legalistic by nature because it is post-justification. We must never tell a person that they must perform some action in order to merit salvation, for we know that justification is by faith only (Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), instead, we would say that if their faith was truly genuine, and they were in fact saved, that their lives would bear the fruits of obedience (Mt 3:8;Jn 15:8,16). &ldquo;*Therefore Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify.*&rdquo;

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">
üçé Fruit grows on salvation<br>
üçé Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees.<br>
üçé A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (Jn 15:4).<br>
üçé Fruit of the spirit not of human decision (Ga 5:22-23).<br>
üçé If the fruit isn't growing the root is dead (Mt 3:10; Jas 2:17; 2Cor.13:5).<br>

> 65\. LEGALISM<br>
WORKING FOR GOD‚ÄôS FAVOUR FORFEITS IT
>
>> . . . do not do what they do, for they do not practise what they preach. They tie up heavy loads and put them on men‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for men to see . . .
Matthew 23:3‚Äì5
>
The New Testament views Christian obedience as the practice of ‚Äògood
deeds‚Äô (works). Christians are to be ‚Äòrich in good deeds‚Äô (1 Tim. 6:18; cf.
Matt. 5:16; Eph. 2:10; 2 Tim. 3:17; Titus 2:7, 14; 3:8, 14). A good deed is
one done (a) according to the right standard (God‚Äôs revealed will, i.e. his
moral law); (b) from a right motive (the love to God and others that marks
the regenerate heart); (c) with a right purpose (pleasing and glorifying God,
honouring Christ, advancing his kingdom, and benefiting one‚Äôs neighbour).
>
Legalism is a distortion of obedience that can never produce truly good
works. Its first fault is that it skews motive and purpose, seeing good deeds
as essentially ways to earn more of God‚Äôs favour than one has at the
moment. Its second fault is arrogance. Belief that one‚Äôs labour earns God‚Äôs
favour begets contempt for those who do not labour in the same way. Its
third fault is love-lessness in that its self-advancing purpose squeezes
humble kindness and creative compassion out of the heart.
>
In the New Testament we meet both Pharisaic and Judaizing legalism.
The Pharisees thought that their status as children of Abraham made God‚Äôs
pleasure in them possible, and that their formalized daily law-keeping,
down to minutest details, would make it actual. The Judaizers viewed
Gentile evangelism as a form of proselytizing for Judaism; they believed
that the Gentile believer in Christ must go on to become a Jew by
circumcision and observance of the festal calendar and ritual law, and that
thus he would gain increased favour with God. Jesus attacked the Pharisees;
Paul, the Judaizers.
>
The Pharisees were formalists, focusing entirely on the externals of
action, disregarding motives and purposes, and reducing life to mechanical
rule-keeping. They thought themselves faithful law-keepers although (a)
they majored in minors, neglecting what matters most (Matt. 23:23‚Äì24); (b)
their casuistry negated the law‚Äôs spirit and aim (Matt. 15:3‚Äì9; 23:16‚Äì24);
(c) they treated traditions of practice as part of God‚Äôs authoritative law, thus binding consciences where God had left them free (Mark 2:16 ‚Äì 3:6; 7:1‚Äì
8); (d) they were hypocrites at heart, angling for man‚Äôs approval all the time
(Luke 20:45‚Äì47; Matt. 6:1‚Äì8; 23:2‚Äì7). Jesus was very sharp with them on
these points.
>
In Galatians, Paul condemns the Judaizers‚Äô ‚ÄòChrist-plus‚Äô message as
obscuring and indeed denying the all-sufficiency of the grace revealed in
Jesus (Gal. 3:1‚Äì3; 4:21; 5:2‚Äì6). In Colossians, he conducts a similar
polemic against a similar ‚ÄòChrist-plus‚Äô formula for ‚Äòfullness‚Äô (i.e. spiritual
completion: Col. 2:8‚Äì23). Any ‚Äòplus‚Äô that requires us to take action in order
to add to what Christ has given us is a reversion to legalism and, in truth, an insult to Christ.
>
So far, then, from enriching our relationship with God, as it seeks to do,
legalism in all its forms does the opposite. It puts that relationship in
jeopardy and, by stopping us focusing on Christ, it starves our souls while
feeding our pride. **Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague.**

<a name="packer-on-liberty" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.2 Dr. J.I. Packer (PhD, University of Oxford) On Liberty</a>

> 64\. LIBERTY<br>
SALVATION BRINGS FREEDOM
>
>> It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
Galatians 5:1
>
The New Testament sees salvation in Christ as liberation and the Christian
life as one of liberty ‚Äì Christ has freed us for freedom (Gal. 5:1; John 8:32,
36). Christ‚Äôs liberating action is not a matter of socio-politico-economic
improvement, as is sometimes suggested today, but relates to the following
three points:
>
**1\.** Christians have been set free from the law as a system of salvation.
Being justified by faith in Christ, they are no longer under God‚Äôs law, but
under his grace (Rom. 3:19; 6:14‚Äì15; Gal. 3:23‚Äì25). This means that their
standing with God (the ‚Äòpeace‚Äô and ‚Äòaccess‚Äô of Rom. 5:1‚Äì2) rests wholly on
the fact that they have been accepted and adopted in Christ. It does not, nor
ever will it, depend on what they do; it will never be imperilled by what
they fail to do. They live, and as long as they are in this world will live, not by being perfect, but by being forgiven.
>
All natural religion, then, is negated, for the natural instinct of fallen
man, as expressed in every form of religion that the world has ever devised,
is to suppose that one gains and keeps a right relationship with ultimate
reality (whether conceived as a personal God or in other terms) by
disciplines of law observance, right ritual, and asceticism. This is how the
world‚Äôs faiths prescribe the establishing of one‚Äôs own righteousness ‚Äì the
very thing Paul saw unbelieving Jews trying to do (Rom. 10:3). Paul‚Äôs
experience had taught him that this is a hopeless enterprise. No human
performance is ever good enough, for there are always wrong desires in the
heart, along with a lack of right ones, regardless of how correct one‚Äôs
outward motions are (Rom. 7:7‚Äì11; cf. Phil. 3:6), and it is at the heart that
God looks first.
>
All the law can do is arouse, expose, and condemn the sin that
permeates our moral make-up, and so make us aware of its reality, depth,
and guilt (Rom. 3:19; 1 Cor. 15:56; Gal. 3:10). So the futility of treating the law as a covenant of works, and seeking righteousness by it, becomes plain
(Gal. 3:10‚Äì12; 4:21‚Äì31), as does the misery of not knowing what else to do.
This is the bondage to the law from which Christ sets us free.
>
**2\.** Christians have been set free from sin‚Äôs domination (John 8:34‚Äì36; Rom. 6:14‚Äì23). They have been supernaturally regenerated and made alive to God through union with Christ in his death and risen life (Rom. 6:3‚Äì11), and this means that the deepest desire of their heart now is to serve God by practising righteousness (Rom. 6:18, 22). Sin‚Äôs domination involved not only constant acts of disobedience, but also a constant lack of zeal for lawkeeping, rising sometimes to positive resentment and hatred towards the law. Now, however, being changed in heart, motivated by gratitude for acceptance through free grace, and energized by the Holy Spirit, they ‚Äòserve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code‚Äô (Rom. 7:6). This means that their attempts at obedience are now joyful and integrated in a way that was never true before. Sin rules them no longer. In this respect, too, they have been liberated from bondage.
>
**3\.** Christians have been set free from the superstition that treats matter and physical pleasure as intrinsically evil. Against this idea, Paul insists that Christians are free to enjoy as God‚Äôs good gifts all created things and the pleasures that they yield (1 Tim. 4:1‚Äì5), provided only that we do not transgress the moral law in our enjoyments or hinder our own spiritual wellbeing or that of others (1 Cor. 6:12‚Äì13; 8:7‚Äì13). The Reformers renewed this emphasis against various forms of medieval legalism.

<a name="Matthew7:21-23" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.3.1 Matthew 7:21-23 IS NOT Teaching Legalism</a>

Jesus warning on the sermon on the mount taught that many would come to him in the last days saying &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; these people come to Jesus fully assured that they belong to him, and he rejects them, thereby exposing their assurance as counterfeit. 

Many people teach this incorrectly by telling people that they must perform some action to merit or earn their way into Heaven... <span style="color:#009933;">The context</span> shows that not only is this about <span style="color:#009933;">fruit-bearing (Mt 7:15-20)</span>, but it's also <span style="color:OrangeRed;">against legalism!</span> Ive color coded fruit bearing green and legalism red. Let's examine the verse:

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô <span style="color:#009933;">will enter the kingdom of heaven</span>, but <span style="color:#009933;">the one who does the will of my Father</span> who is in heaven. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">On that day many will say to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,</span> <span style="color:OrangeRed;">did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?</span>‚Äô <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">And then will I declare to them, ‚ÄòI never [knew](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#foreknew) you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.‚Äô</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:21-23

Here we can identify three types of individuals exhibiting assent to facts (notitia and assensus) but not "trust and reliance" (fiducia) that defines genuine saving faith.

1. <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;**did we not** prophesy in your name&rdquo;</span>
2. <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;and cast out demons in your name&rdquo;</span>
3. <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;and do many mighty **works** in your name?&rdquo;</span>

These all seem to me, to be legalistic pleas. They are all appealing to God, their works, as a reason why they should be admitted into heaven. Instead they should have had "trust and reliance" upon God's grace through faith only. This is why it's important to teach <span style="color:#009933;">&ldquo;resulting&rdquo; obedience</span> to God instead of <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;including&rdquo; obedience</span>. **You cannot merit your own salvation, and if you rely on your own efforts you're doomed.**

> Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague &mdash; [**Dr. J. I. Packer**](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8) (Ph.D., University of Oxford) [Concise Theology. Chapter 65 Legalism. p. 191.](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A)

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:OrangeRed">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)

<a name="James2:14-26" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.3.2 James 2:14-26 IS NOT Teaching Legalism</a>

&ldquo;*faith without works is dead*&rdquo; is not speaking about things you must do to be saved, it's speaking about things you will do if your faith is genuine (already saved).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if **someone** says he has faith but does not have works? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Can that faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">save him</span>?</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and filled,‚Äù without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> So also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">faith by itself, if it does not have works, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:14-17 ESV

Understanding James 2:24 is the difference between having sound doctrine, being legalist, or being antinomian. [Sproul](https://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q?si=jId5EfSDUTEhMmMS&t=71) actually explains this really well.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">You see that a person is justified by works and <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red">not by faith alone</span>.</span> ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">faith apart from works <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:20,24,26 ESV

If the Bible is to work together, Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28 & James 2:24 must be reconciled together. We accomplish this by observing, carefully, the context. In verses where the Apostle Paul is teaching that we're no longer under the law of moses<sup style="font-weight:bold;">Point 1</sup>, he is teaching that justification in the sight of God is by faith only; whereas, James in James 2:24 is speaking of Justification in the sight of men<sup style="font-weight:bold;">Points 2-6</sup>, the fruits of the faith, Godly dispositions of love, the good deeds and services that spring forth from a true and lively faith.

1. Verses against legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. Verses against antinomianism (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62)
3. Verses for obedience after salvation (1Jn 2:3-6; 3:6-10; 5:3-4 Jn 14:15,21; 15:10)
4. Verses for Godly dispositions of Love (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35)
5. Verses for Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; Gal 5:22-23)
6. Verses for good works after salvation (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)

> When James says that faith without works is dead (i.e. a corpse), he is
using the word faith in the limited sense of notitia plus assensus, which is
how those he addresses were using it. When he says that one is justified by
what one does, not by faith alone, he means by ‚Äòjustified‚Äô ‚Äòproved genuine;
vindicated from the suspicion of being a hypocrite and a fraud‚Äô. James is
making the point that barren orthodoxy saves no-one (Jas. 2:14‚Äì26). Paul
would have agreed, and James‚Äôs whole letter shows him agreeing with Paul
that faith must change one‚Äôs life. Paul denounces the idea of salvation by
dead works; James rejects salvation by dead faith. &mdash; <a href="#packer-on-works">Packer on works.</a>

<a name="Romans2:7,13" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.3.3 Romans 2:7,13 IS NOT Teaching Legalism</a>

<!-- This one is another instance of legalists taking things out of context. Upon first inspection and cherry picking of the verse it would seem like a strong case, but when one looks at the overall message in context we can see that Christ is explaining that  -->

All works mentioned in the NT should be viewed through the lens of <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo;</span> fruit-bearing, not meritorious works righteousness. Since the Bible is very explicit about being justified by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom. 3:28). This reminds me of Mt 5:17 where the gist of the message is that we need Christ to be the perfect archetypal law-keeper because we simply cannot, we are [totally depraved](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/total-depravity/) and unable to merit our own salvation (Isaiah 64:6 NLT).

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed">eternal life to those who by perseverance in good works</span> seek glory and honor and immortality &mdash; Romans 2:7 NET

> For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed">the doers of the law who will be justified</span>. &mdash; Romans 2:13 ESV

<!-- > Are just - Are justified before God, or are personally holy. Or, in other words, simply hearing the Law is not meeting all its requirements, and making people holy. If they expected to be saved by the Law, it required something more than merely to hear it. It demanded perfect obedience. &mdash; [Barnes' Notes on the Bible](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/romans/2-13.htm) -->

The New Oxford Annotated Bible, Fifth (NRSV) has a very revealing thing to say about this verse.

> **13**: The statement that it is the doers of the law who will be justified serves as **a building block in Paul‚Äôs argument toward his central conviction that all have sinned and consequently justification comes only as God‚Äôs gift through faith (Ro 3.23-25).** &mdash; New Oxford Annotated Bible (Fifth) on Romans 2:13 NRSV. Over 50 years of students, and professors, relying on The New Oxford Annotated Bible as an unparalleled authority. 

<a name="James1:22" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.3.4 James 1:22 IS NOT Teaching Legalism</a>

All works mentioned in the NT should be viewed through the lens of <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo;</span> fruit-bearing, not meritorious works righteousness. The cults will attempt to teach you <span style="color:Red;">&ldquo;*included*&rdquo;</span> fruits, or <span style="color:Red">&ldquo;*plus works*&rdquo;</span>, but the Bible is very clear that these are <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo;</span> works that come after you're already saved as an evidence of genuine saving faith.

<!-- > But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves.
>> But don‚Äôt just listen to God‚Äôs word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves.
> &mdash; James 1:22 NET, NLT (Parallel) -->

> But **be doers** of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
>> But don‚Äôt just listen to God‚Äôs word. **You must do what it says.** Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves.
> &mdash; James 1:22 ESV, NLT (Parallel)

It will also help you to make the distinction between justification (which is by faith alone Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and assurance of salvation which is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT) &ldquo;*we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.*... *That is how we know we are living in him.*&rdquo;

> **Biblical faith is evidence-based.**... **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing. ... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*. p. 136, 218, 313.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#lennox)

Evidence is something that happens after-the-fact, after we're justified by faith alone. Then you can inspect for sanctification, which is a <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo;</span> fruit, not an <span style="color:Red;">&ldquo;*included*&rdquo;</span> work. You cannot add to or improve upon the Cross. The Cross is sufficent.

<a name="antinomianism" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">2. The Heresy Of Antinomianism</a>

Jude calls the church to defend the truth aggressively against this infiltration. Pay careful attention to the striking condemnation from Jude in this passage. The main points being the identifying points. The individuals who are marked out for condemnation meet the following criteria: 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">ungodly men</span> who have turned the grace of our God into a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">license for evil</span></span> and who <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;;">deny our only <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Master and Lord</span>, Jesus Christ</span>. &mdash; Jude 1:4 NET

They pervert, twist, and distort the gospel, falsely teaching that our God's grace allows them to live immoral lives.

These persons professed to be Christians and were influential teachers of

The phrase *"deny Jesus as Master and Lord"* is eerily reminiscent of modern neotheologies of today. They use the gospel to teach that grace is an excuse for ungodly living (cf. Rom. 3:8; 6:1, 15; 2 Pet. 3:15‚Äì16). Some even claiming you don't need to accept Jesus as Master & Lord to be saved!

<!-- The Bible describes these ungodly men as worming (Jude 4 NLT) their way into churches (i.e. subversive) to preach and teach destructive heresies, even to the point of denying the Master who bought them.

Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically. A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (John 15:1-17). If a tree was genuinely alive it would bear fruit. It's the fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23). If the fruit isn‚Äôt growing the root is dead (Mt 3:8,10; Jn 15:8; Jas 2:17).

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em">This message is not legalistic</span>, it is not speaking of meriting or earning your salvation. This is speaking of the fruit of genuine saving faith. This is also not speaking of perfection (1Jn 2:1-3). It is simply saying, that if your faith is not superficial, your life will bear fruit (Gal 5:22-23; John 15:1-17). Justification is by faith alone (Rom. 3:28; Eph 2:8-10), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (Jn 14:15,21).

Saving faith <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;**does not include**&rdquo;</span> obedience, saving faith <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;**results in**&rdquo;</span> obedience. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts but instead a trust and reliance in Christ.

Practice in this sense means a lifelong continual pattern. It speaks of the pursuit of a lifestyle of indulgent sin. This does not mean that you will not have sin or that you will be perfect, in fact you may struggle with sin, make mistakes, and even backslide. A true Christian will undergo decreasing patterns of sin (1 John 3:8‚Äì9; cf. Rom. 6:14‚Äì18) in their progressive sanctification. They will not remain in their old way of life (2 Cor. 5:17; 1Jn 3:31).

<a name="packer-on-antinomianism" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">2.1 Dr. J.I. Packer (PhD, University of Oxford) On Antinomianism</a>

> 66\. ANTINOMIANISM<br>
WE ARE NOT SET FREE TO SIN
>
>>Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right
is righteous, just as he [Christ] is righteous.
1 John 3:7
>
Antinomianism, which means being ‚Äòanti-law‚Äô, is a name for several views
that have denied that God‚Äôs law in Scripture should directly control the
Christian‚Äôs life.
>
**Dualistic antinomianism** appears in the Gnostic heretics against whom
Jude and Peter wrote (Jude 4‚Äì19; 2 Pet. 2). This view sees salvation as for
the soul only, and bodily behaviour as irrelevant both to God‚Äôs interest and
to the soul‚Äôs health, so one may behave riotously and it will not matter.
>
**Spirit-centred antinomianism** puts such trust in the Holy Spirit‚Äôs inward
prompting as to deny any need to be taught by the law how to live. Freedom
from the law as a way of salvation is assumed to bring with it freedom from
the law as a guide to conduct. In the first hundred and fifty years of the
Reformation era this kind of antinomianism often threatened, and Paul‚Äôs
insistence that a truly spiritual person acknowledges the authority of God‚Äôs
Word through Christ‚Äôs apostles (1 Cor. 14:37; cf. 7:40) suggests that the
Spirit-obsessed Corinthian church was in the grip of the same mindset.
>
**Christ-centred antinomianism** argues that God sees no sin in believers,
because they are in Christ, who kept the law for them, and therefore what
they actually do makes no difference, provided that they keep believing.
But 1 John 1:8 ‚Äì 2:1 (expounding 1:7) and 3:4‚Äì10 point in a different
direction, showing that it is not possible to be in Christ and at the same time to embrace sin as a way of life.
>
**Dispensational antinomianism** holds that keeping the moral law is at no
stage necessary for Christians, since we live under a dispensation of grace,
not of law. Romans 3:31 and 1 Corinthians 6:9‚Äì11 clearly show, however,
that law-keeping is a continuing obligation for Christians. ‚ÄòI am not free
from God‚Äôs law but am under Christ‚Äôs law,‚Äô says Paul (1 Cor. 9:21).
>
**Dialectical antinomianism**, as in Barth and Brunner, denies that biblical
law is God‚Äôs direct command and affirms that the Bible‚Äôs imperative
statements trigger the Word of the Spirit, which when it comes may or may
not correspond exactly to what is written. The inadequacy of the neoorthodox view of biblical authority, which explains the inspiration of
Scripture in terms of the Bible‚Äôs instrumentality as a channel for God‚Äôs
present-day utterances to his people, is evident here.
>
**Situationist antinomianism** says that a motive and intention of love is all
that God now requires of Christians, and the commands of the Decalogue
and other ethical parts of Scripture, for all that they are ascribed to God
directly, are mere rules of thumb for loving, rules that love may at any time
disregard. But Romans 13:8‚Äì10, to which this view appeals, teaches that
without love as a motive these specific commands cannot be fulfilled. Once
more an unacceptably weak view of Scripture surfaces.
>
It must be stressed that the moral law, as crystallized in the Decalogue
and opened up in the ethical teaching of both Testaments, is one coherent
law, given to be a code of practice for God‚Äôs people in every age. In
addition, repentance means resolving henceforth to seek God‚Äôs help in
keeping that law. The Spirit is given to empower law-keeping and make us
more and more like Christ, the archetypal law-keeper (Matt. 5:17). This
law-keeping is in fact the fulfilling of our human nature, and Scripture
holds out no hope of salvation for any who, whatever their profession of
faith, do not seek to turn from sin to righteousness (1 Cor. 6:9‚Äì11; Rev.
21:8).

This teaching isn't limited to false teachers only, as the fruit-bearing metaphor is applied to all the people of God. Even so far back as the Old Testament (Ps 1:3). Logically, false teachers create false disciples.

True believers will always be marked by the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal 5:22-23) and fakes will always demonstrate the works of the flesh (Gal 5:19-21).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">19</sup> When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these.

Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically. A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (John 15:1-17). If a tree was genuinely alive it would bear fruit. It's the fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23). If the fruit isn‚Äôt growing the root is dead (Mt 3:8,10; Jn 15:8; Jas 2:17).

<a name="packer-on-works" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.1 Dr. J.I. Packer (PhD, University of Oxford) On Resulting Works (Fruits)</a>

> 59\. WORKS<br>
GOOD WORKS ARE AN EXPRESSION OF FAITH
>
>>You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.
James 2:24
>
In the New Testament, faith (believing trust, or trustful belief, based on testimony received as from God) is crucially important, for it is the means or instrumental cause of salvation. It is by faith that Christians are justified before God (Rom. 3:26; 4:1‚Äì5; Gal. 2:16), live their lives (literally ‚Äòwalk‚Äô, 2 Cor. 5:7), and sustain their hope (Heb. 10:35 ‚Äì 12:3).
>
Faith cannot be defined in subjective terms, as a confident and
optimistic mindset, or in passive terms, as acquiescent orthodoxy or
confidence in God without commitment to God. Faith is an object-oriented
response, shaped by that which is trusted, namely God himself, God‚Äôs
promises, and Jesus Christ, all as set forth in the Scriptures. And faith is a
whole-souled response, involving mind, heart, will, and affections. Older
Reformed theology analysed faith as notitia (‚Äòknowledge‚Äô, i.e. acquaintance
with the content of the gospel), plus assensus (‚Äòagreement‚Äô, i.e. recognition
that the gospel is true), plus fiducia (‚Äòtrust and reliance‚Äô, i.e. personal
dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with
thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one‚Äôs own
righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3). Without fiducia there is no faith, but
without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14).
>
God‚Äôs gift of faith is a fruit of applicatory illumination by the Holy
Spirit, and it ordinarily has in it some measure of conscious-assurance
through the witnessing of the Spirit (Rom. 8:15‚Äì17). Calvin defined faith as
‚Äòa firm and sure knowledge of the divine favour towards us, founded on the
truth of a free promise in Christ, and revealed to our minds and sealed on
our hearts by the Holy Spirit.‚Äô **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism. Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‚Äòfaith apart from observing the law‚Äô, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are.** But if ‚Äògood works‚Äô (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, justifying faith (fiducia) is not yet ours. The truth is that, though we are justified by faith alone, the faith that justifies is never alone. It produces moral fruit; it expresses itself ‚Äòthrough love‚Äô (Gal. 5:6); it transforms one‚Äôs way of living; it begets virtue. This is not only because holiness is commanded, but also because the regenerate heart, of which fiducia is the expression, desires holiness and can find full contentment only in seeking it.
>
When James says that faith without works is dead (i.e. a corpse), he is
using the word faith in the limited sense of notitia plus assensus, which is
how those he addresses were using it. When he says that one is justified by
what one does, not by faith alone, he means by ‚Äòjustified‚Äô ‚Äòproved genuine;
vindicated from the suspicion of being a hypocrite and a fraud‚Äô. James is
making the point that barren orthodoxy saves no-one (Jas. 2:14‚Äì26). Paul
would have agreed, and James‚Äôs whole letter shows him agreeing with Paul
that faith must change one‚Äôs life. Paul denounces the idea of salvation by
dead works; James rejects salvation by dead faith.
> 
Though the believer‚Äôs works do not merit salvation and always have
something imperfect about them (Rom. 7:13‚Äì20; Gal. 5:17), in their
character as expressions of the love and fidelity that faith calls forth they
are the basis on which God promises rewards in heaven (Phil. 3:12‚Äì14; 2
Tim. 4:7‚Äì8). For God thus to reward us according to our works is, as
Augustine noted, his gracious crowning of his own gracious gifts.

> A second way of knowing that we have eternal life is **by observing the spiritual and moral outworking of our faith in our behaviour**:
>> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. The man who says, ‚ÄúI know him,‚Äù but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. (1 John 2:3‚Äì4.)

>>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death. (1 John 3:14.)
>
Jesus made a similar point when he said, **by their fruit you will recognise them (Matthew 7:20)**. **If there is no moral consistency between our lives and our professed belief in God, then our claim to know God will not be credible.** It is in this context that Peter exhorts his readers to make your calling and election sure by our development of Christian character and moral virtues. The phrase ‚Äúmaking sure‚Äù means ‚Äúconfirming‚Äù. That is, the development of visible Christian moral virtues in **a person‚Äôs life confirms the genuineness of their claim to be believers. True faith in God will be evidenced by its moral consequences in the life of a believer.** &mdash; &ldquo;[*Determined to Believe?*]()&rdquo; p. 313.

> As Augustine wrote, ‚ÄúDo not make judgments about whom God draws and whom He does not draw, unless you wish to fall into error. Accept this once and for all, and understand it: you are not yet drawn to God? Pray that you may be drawn!‚Äù73 **God‚Äôs responsibility is to bring forth spiritual fruit** through his Word that we share. Recall the teaching of St. Paul that human messengers sow the seed of the Word and water it, but **it is God who makes the seed grow (1 Cor 3:6-7)**. We preach, we persuade, and we plead with sinners to repent and be reconciled to God. But **ultimately we know that it is the sovereign and all-powerful God who gives spiritual fruit**. It is he who draws sinners to Christ, who causes the church to multiply, who makes the Gospel prevail and break down strongholds. Thus as Christ‚Äôs servants faithfully preach the Gospel we need not fear that our words will fall on deaf and unresponsive ears, for God has promised that his Word will prosper. The Lord encourages us through the prophet Isaiah:
>
>>As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. ‚Äî 55:10-11

> Indeed, wherever faith exists, one finds proof of the soul‚Äôs prior regeneration. ‚ÄúFaith in the living God and his Son Jesus Christ is always the result of the new birth, and can never exist except in the regenerate.‚Äù66 Spurgeon added that repentance, an effect of faith, includes sorrow for transgressions and a forsaking of all known sins. Likewise a fruit of the new birth, repentance also is a gift of God‚Äôs grace.

<!-- > As to whether true believers can forfeit salvation, consider Jesus‚Äô allegory of the vine and the branches (John 15:1-8). Jesus said, ‚Äúmy Father . . . cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful‚Äù (vv. 1-2). **The dry and fruitless branches cut off signify professed believers whom Christ rejects because their relation to him was not genuine.** The Lord referred to the perdition of unregenerate professors such as Judas in v. 6: ‚ÄúIf anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe absence of fruit in the branch of the vine casts grave doubt upon its real union with the central stem, however attractive it may appear. Such useless members must be cut off.‚Äù57
>
Did Paul teach that Christians can forfeit salvation when he wrote to the
Galatians, ‚Äúyou have fallen away from grace‚Äù (Gal 5:4)? The apostle clarified the meaning of this statement by the words that precede: ‚ÄúYou who
are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ.‚Äù Paul‚Äôs
readers were immature believers who, influenced by Jewish legalists, lapsed
in their understanding of God‚Äôs plan of salvation by grace through faith.
What the erring Galatians did was to defect from a theology of justification by grace to a theology of justification by law-keeping. They were running the race well until the Judaizers caused them to turn aside. Paul expressed confidence that the erring saints would soon return to the truth (v. 10). Thus this text does not uphold the apostasy of genuine Christians
>
...
>
John plainly taught that those who withdrew from the believing community never were saved in the first place. ‚ÄúThey went out from us, but
they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would
have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged
to us‚Äù (1 John 2:19). It is not always possible to distinguish between the
saved and the unsaved. But God grants the saved grace that enables them
to endure; those who fail to endure do so because they never possessed
regenerating and preserving grace. In writing ‚ÄúAnyone who runs ahead
and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God‚Äù (2
John 9a), John described Gnostic/Docetic teachers who claimed to have
advanced beyond apostolic teaching about Christ but who failed to continue therein.

>> I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He
cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every
branch that does bear fruit he prunes so it will be even more
fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I have
spoken to you. Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No
branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine.
Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am
the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and
I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do
nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a
branch that isthrown away and withers; such branches are
picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.
>
This particular passage is speaking poignantly about the
believer's union with Christ. This union serves as the basis for
all fruitfulness in the Christian's experience, for apart from him
we can do nothing. However, as I. Howard Marshall states:
>
>>John thus uses the verb "abide" [remain] to express the
need for disciples to continue in their personal commitment
to Jesus; the abiding of Jesus in them is not an automatic
process which is independent of their attitude to Him, but
is the reverse side of their abiding in Him. Just as men are
summoned to believe in Jesus, so they are summoned to
abide in Jesus, i.e., to continue believing."
>
**In other words, the branch's attachment to the vine-indeed, the individual's union with Christ-is what makes possible a life characterized by Christian virtue and fruitfulness.** C. K. Barrett proclaims that "this union, originating in his initiative and sealed by his death on their behalf, is completed by the believer's responsive love and obedience, and is the essence of Christianity."

> **E. True and False Disciples**
>
**1\. Beware of False Prophets**
>
The text of Wesley‚Äôs twelfth discourse on the Sermon on the Mount is Matthew 7:15 ‚Äì 20 on false prophets:
>
>> ‚ÄúWatch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep‚Äôs clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">By their fruit you will recognize them.</span> Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">A good tree cannot bear bad fruit</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Red;">a bad tree cannot bear good fruit</span>. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Orange;">fire</span>. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.‚Äù [NIV; Homily #32, ‚ÄúUpon Our Lord‚Äôs Sermon on the Mount: Discourse 12,‚Äù B 1:675 ‚Äì 86, J V:413 ‚Äì 22 (1750)]
>
There are compelling reasons why Jesus so solemnly cautioned us in the Sermon on the Mount to discern false prophecy.144 Countless souls run toward destruction because they follow evil teachers who refuse to walk in the narrow way even when they are aware of the hazards of destruction.145 They have so many companions on this broad way that they are mesmerized by its popularity. ‚ÄúSuch is the amazing influence of example over the weak.‚Äù146
>
To guard as many as possible against this contagion, God has called forth watchmen to cry out, to show multitudes the danger they are in. Throughout the generations, God has sent prophets ‚Äúto point out the narrow path, and exhort all men not to be conformed to this world.‚Äù147
>
But what happens ‚Äúif the watchmen themselves fall into the snare against which they should warn others‚Äù?148 What if they deceive the people to fall into the errors of the watchmen?149 We find such deceivers in every age and nation.
>
Wesley asks who are these false prophets, what is their typical disguise, and by what means can the faithful discover who they are and discern their reliability?
>
**a. Outwardly They Appear in Sheep‚Äôs Clothing**
>
Ravenous wolves can appear in innocent sheep‚Äôs clothing.150 Wesley found it necessary to speak out in ‚Äúrough, plain truths, such as none can deny.‚Äù151 They ‚Äúteach a false way to heaven.‚Äù152 They pretend to ‚Äúspeak in the name of God,‚Äù professing ‚Äúto be sent of God, to teach others the way to heaven.‚Äù153 They have taken Holy Scripture and grossly distorted it. They appear to clarify God‚Äôs Word while undermining it. They distort the truthful stability of apostolic teaching. Their teaching causes the destruction of others. ‚ÄúSince you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless.‚Äù154
>
As Jesus had established in the previous verses: ‚ÄúEvery broad way is infallibly a false one.‚Äù Jesus‚Äô ‚Äúplain, sure rule‚Äù is this: ‚ÄúThose who teach others to walk in a broad way are false prophets.‚Äù155 The true way to heaven by Jesus‚Äô definition is always a narrow way. Narrowness is intrinsic to the definition of the way of life. ‚ÄúThey are false prophets who do not teach men to walk in this way.‚Äù156 The way to participate in life in Christ has already been made clear. It is ‚Äúlowliness, mourning, meekness, and holy desire, love of God and of our neighbor, doing good, and suffering evil for Christ‚Äôs sake.‚Äù157 It matters less what you call this way than that you follow it.158
>
They are false prophets ‚Äúwho teach the directly opposite way, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">the way of pride ‚Ä¶ of worldly desires, of loving pleasure more than God</span>, of unkindness to our neighbor, of <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">unconcern for good works</span>.‚Äù159 They may appear at first to be ‚Äúwise and honorable.‚Äù Meanwhile they teach others to imagine they are on the way to heaven while stumbling in the opposite direction.160 They are ‚Äútraitors both to God and man,‚Äù because their teaching ends in destroying the souls of others.
>
**b. They Appear Harmless, Useful, Religious, and Loving**
>
The false prophets come in disguise, ‚Äúwith an appearance of harmlessness. They come in the most mild, inoffensive manner, without any mark or token of enmity. Who can imagine that these quiet creatures would do any hurt to anyone?‚Äù161
>
They come with ‚Äúan appearance of usefulness,‚Äù with the pretense that they were ‚Äúset apart for this very thing ‚Ä¶ particularly commissioned to watch over your soul‚Äù and teach you about ‚Äúhealing those that are oppressed.‚Äù162 And they come ‚Äúwith an appearance of religion,‚Äù as if ‚Äúall they do is for conscience‚Äô sake!‚Äù While they appear to be zealous for God, ‚Äúthey are making God a liar.‚Äù163 They may even have a stamp of approval or degree certifying their religious qualifications.
>
Finally, they come ‚Äúwith an appearance of love,‚Äù making conspicuous ‚Äúprofessions of their goodwill, and of their concern.‚Äù164
>
**2\. Know Them by Their Fruits**
>
How do we recognize false teachers? How do we find out what they are really up to? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">By their fruit we will recognize them.</span>165 Our Lord was not a master of disguise; he was a master of removing disguises. He did not propose a long, complicated series of arguments by which one might analyze deception, but rather ‚Äúa short and plain rule, easy to be understood‚Äù by anyone on any occasion: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">‚ÄúYou shall know them by their fruits.‚Äù</span>166
>
To discover their fruitfulness, ask first, ‚ÄúWhat effect does their teaching have on their own behavior? Does their temperament show a picture of that mind in them which is in Christ Jesus? Are they in practice ‚Äòmeek, lowly, patient, lovers of God and man, and zealous of good works‚Äô?‚Äù167 Then ask, ‚ÄúWhat are the fruits of their teaching?‚Äù Look at those who are following them: <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Do they walk as Christ walked? If not, then you know that God has not sent them.</span>168
>
**a. Analogies for Determining Authenticity of Witnesses**
>
Our Lord has provided several clear and convincing analogies for discernment. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">Jesus asked the multitude on the mount to consider: ‚ÄúDo people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?‚Äù169 ‚ÄúDo you expect that these evil men should bring forth good fruit?</span> As well might you expect that thorns should bring forth grapes, or that figs should grow upon thistles!‚Äù170 <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">A true prophet sent by God will bear the fruits of holy living.</span> A false prophet, a teacher not sent by God, will bring forth corruption. A true prophet or teacher ‚Äúdoes not bring forth evil fruit accidentally or sometimes only, but always, and of necessity.‚Äù171 Test them by their fruits in engendering the holy life.172
>
‚ÄúEvery tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.‚Äù173 The outcome of the teaching of false prophets will always be destructiveness lacking saving grace.
>
**b. They Come to Destroy**
>
Their purpose is to destroy the worshiping community. ‚ÄúThey only destroy and devour the flock. They tear them in pieces‚Ä¶. O beware they do not turn you out of the way.‚Äù174 ‚ÄúThey come to you in sheep‚Äôs clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.‚Äù175
>
If this is what Jesus taught, should believers even listen to the ordained ministers who evidence false teaching? Surprisingly, Wesley turned to the unique wisdom of the Lord in Matthew 23:2 ‚Äì 4: ‚ÄúThe teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses‚Äô seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.‚Äù176 Do what Jesus did. Jesus himself listened to them but judged them by their fruits. To the people he gave the warning: It is not forbidden that you listen even to false prophets, but attend to the quality of lives they lead and elicit in others.177
>
In listening to and discerning false and true prophets, do not cut the people of God off from the ordinances of God. ‚ÄúThe validity of the ordinance doth not depend on the goodness of him that administers [it], but on the faithfulness of him that ordained it. Do not neglect the sacraments just because they are offered by those who teach inappropriately‚Ä¶. Even by these who are under a curse themselves, God can and doth give us his blessing. For the bread which they break, we have experimentally known to be ‚Äòthe communion of the body of Christ,‚Äô and the cup which God blessed, even by their unhallowed lips, was to us the communion of the blood of Christ.‚Äù178
>
Do not let the false teachers prevent you from hearing the Word and receiving the sacrament. ‚ÄúWait upon God by humble and earnest prayer, and then act according to the best light you have. Act according to what you are persuaded, upon the whole, will be most for your spiritual advantage. Take great care that you do not judge rashly; that you do not lightly think any to be false prophets: and when you have full proof, see that no anger or contempt have any place in your heart.‚Äù179
>
After you have listened to and received their ministries, determine for yourself in the presence and in the fear of God what you should do. God will guide you. ‚ÄúIf by experience you find that the hearing them hurts your soul, then hear them not; then quietly refrain, and hear those that profit you. If, on the other hand, you find it does not hurt your soul, you then may hear them still. Only ‚Äòtake heed how you hear‚Äô.‚Ä¶ Hear with fear and trembling, lest you should be deceived. Receive nothing untried, nothing till it is weighed in the balance of the sanctuary‚Äù and confirmed by Holy Writ.180
>
**c. Woe: A Word to False Prophets**
>
Jesus pronounced woe upon the blind leaders of the blind who shut the kingdom of heaven against men and women.181 Similarly Paul in Paphos, ‚Äúfilled with the Holy Spirit,‚Äù excoriated the sorcerer Elymas: ‚ÄúYou are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun.‚Äù182 False disciples are responsible for their false teachings.
>
Ezekiel‚Äôs warning is pertinent to false prophets of all times: ‚ÄúWhen I say to the wicked, ‚ÄòYou wicked person, you will surely die,‚Äô and you do not speak out to dissuade them from their ways, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.‚Äù183
>
To the false teachers in Wesley‚Äôs day, he said similarly, ‚ÄúThus you cause them to stumble at the very threshold; yea, to fall and rise no more‚Ä¶. How long will ye pervert the right ways of the Lord, putting darkness for light, and light for darkness? How long will ye teach the way of death, and call it the way of life?‚Äù184
>
The annoying presence of false teachers does not cause the faithful to harden their hearts. Rather, it prompts them to open their eyes. ‚ÄúEternity is at stake.‚Äù185 Ask God first to quicken your own soul, giving you the faith that works by love. In this way, the Spirit of glory and of Christ shall rest upon you. God will make it known whom he has and has not sent. So shall the word of God in your mouth be ‚Äúlike a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces.‚Äù186 So shall the teachers both true and false be known by their fruits.187
