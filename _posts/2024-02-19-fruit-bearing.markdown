>> . . . do not do what they do, for they do not practise what they preach. They tie up heavy loads and put them on men‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for men to see . . .
Matthew 23:3‚Äì5
>
The New Testament views Christian obedience as the practice of ‚Äògood
deeds‚Äô (works). Christians are to be ‚Äòrich in good deeds‚Äô (1 Tim. 6:18; cf.
Matt. 5:16; Eph. 2:10; 2 Tim. 3:17; Titus 2:7, 14; 3:8, 14). A good deed is
one done (a) according to the right standard (God‚Äôs revealed will, i.e. his
moral law); (b) from a right motive (the love to God and others that marks
the regenerate heart); (c) with a right purpose (pleasing and glorifying God,
honouring Christ, advancing his kingdom, and benefiting one‚Äôs neighbour).
>
Legalism is a distortion of obedience that can never produce truly good
works. Its first fault is that it skews motive and purpose, seeing good deeds
as essentially ways to earn more of God‚Äôs favour than one has at the
moment. Its second fault is arrogance. Belief that one‚Äôs labour earns God‚Äôs
favour begets contempt for those who do not labour in the same way. Its
third fault is love-lessness in that its self-advancing purpose squeezes
humble kindness and creative compassion out of the heart.
>
In the New Testament we meet both Pharisaic and Judaizing legalism.
The Pharisees thought that their status as children of Abraham made God‚Äôs
pleasure in them possible, and that their formalized daily law-keeping,
down to minutest details, would make it actual. The Judaizers viewed
Gentile evangelism as a form of proselytizing for Judaism; they believed
that the Gentile believer in Christ must go on to become a Jew by
circumcision and observance of the festal calendar and ritual law, and that
thus he would gain increased favour with God. Jesus attacked the Pharisees;
Paul, the Judaizers.
>
The Pharisees were formalists, focusing entirely on the externals of
action, disregarding motives and purposes, and reducing life to mechanical
rule-keeping. They thought themselves faithful law-keepers although (a)
they majored in minors, neglecting what matters most (Matt. 23:23‚Äì24); (b)
their casuistry negated the law‚Äôs spirit and aim (Matt. 15:3‚Äì9; 23:16‚Äì24);
(c) they treated traditions of practice as part of God‚Äôs authoritative law, thus binding consciences where God had left them free (Mark 2:16 ‚Äì 3:6; 7:1‚Äì
8); (d) they were hypocrites at heart, angling for man‚Äôs approval all the time
(Luke 20:45‚Äì47; Matt. 6:1‚Äì8; 23:2‚Äì7). Jesus was very sharp with them on
these points.
>
In Galatians, Paul condemns the Judaizers‚Äô ‚ÄòChrist-plus‚Äô message as
obscuring and indeed denying the all-sufficiency of the grace revealed in
Jesus (Gal. 3:1‚Äì3; 4:21; 5:2‚Äì6). In Colossians, he conducts a similar
polemic against a similar ‚ÄòChrist-plus‚Äô formula for ‚Äòfullness‚Äô (i.e. spiritual
completion: Col. 2:8‚Äì23). Any ‚Äòplus‚Äô that requires us to take action in order
to add to what Christ has given us is a reversion to legalism and, in truth, an insult to Christ.
>
So far, then, from enriching our relationship with God, as it seeks to do,
legalism in all its forms does the opposite. It puts that relationship in
jeopardy and, by stopping us focusing on Christ, it starves our souls while
feeding our pride. **Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague.**

<a name="packer-on-liberty" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.2 Dr. J.I. Packer (PhD, University of Oxford) On Liberty</a>

> 64\. LIBERTY<br>
SALVATION BRINGS FREEDOM
>
>> It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
Galatians 5:1
>
The New Testament sees salvation in Christ as liberation and the Christian
life as one of liberty ‚Äì Christ has freed us for freedom (Gal. 5:1; John 8:32,
36). Christ‚Äôs liberating action is not a matter of socio-politico-economic
improvement, as is sometimes suggested today, but relates to the following
three points:
>
**1\.** Christians have been set free from the law as a system of salvation.
Being justified by faith in Christ, they are no longer under God‚Äôs law, but
under his grace (Rom. 3:19; 6:14‚Äì15; Gal. 3:23‚Äì25). This means that their
standing with God (the ‚Äòpeace‚Äô and ‚Äòaccess‚Äô of Rom. 5:1‚Äì2) rests wholly on
the fact that they have been accepted and adopted in Christ. It does not, nor
ever will it, depend on what they do; it will never be imperilled by what
they fail to do. They live, and as long as they are in this world will live, not by being perfect, but by being forgiven.
>
All natural religion, then, is negated, for the natural instinct of fallen
man, as expressed in every form of religion that the world has ever devised,
is to suppose that one gains and keeps a right relationship with ultimate
reality (whether conceived as a personal God or in other terms) by
disciplines of law observance, right ritual, and asceticism. This is how the
world‚Äôs faiths prescribe the establishing of one‚Äôs own righteousness ‚Äì the
very thing Paul saw unbelieving Jews trying to do (Rom. 10:3). Paul‚Äôs
experience had taught him that this is a hopeless enterprise. No human
performance is ever good enough, for there are always wrong desires in the
heart, along with a lack of right ones, regardless of how correct one‚Äôs
outward motions are (Rom. 7:7‚Äì11; cf. Phil. 3:6), and it is at the heart that
God looks first.
>
All the law can do is arouse, expose, and condemn the sin that
permeates our moral make-up, and so make us aware of its reality, depth,
and guilt (Rom. 3:19; 1 Cor. 15:56; Gal. 3:10). So the futility of treating the law as a covenant of works, and seeking righteousness by it, becomes plain
(Gal. 3:10‚Äì12; 4:21‚Äì31), as does the misery of not knowing what else to do.
This is the bondage to the law from which Christ sets us free.
>
**2\.** Christians have been set free from sin‚Äôs domination (John 8:34‚Äì36; Rom. 6:14‚Äì23). They have been supernaturally regenerated and made alive to God through union with Christ in his death and risen life (Rom. 6:3‚Äì11), and this means that the deepest desire of their heart now is to serve God by practising righteousness (Rom. 6:18, 22). Sin‚Äôs domination involved not only constant acts of disobedience, but also a constant lack of zeal for lawkeeping, rising sometimes to positive resentment and hatred towards the law. Now, however, being changed in heart, motivated by gratitude for acceptance through free grace, and energized by the Holy Spirit, they ‚Äòserve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code‚Äô (Rom. 7:6). This means that their attempts at obedience are now joyful and integrated in a way that was never true before. Sin rules them no longer. In this respect, too, they have been liberated from bondage.
>
**3\.** Christians have been set free from the superstition that treats matter and physical pleasure as intrinsically evil. Against this idea, Paul insists that Christians are free to enjoy as God‚Äôs good gifts all created things and the pleasures that they yield (1 Tim. 4:1‚Äì5), provided only that we do not transgress the moral law in our enjoyments or hinder our own spiritual wellbeing or that of others (1 Cor. 6:12‚Äì13; 8:7‚Äì13). The Reformers renewed this emphasis against various forms of medieval legalism.

<a name="Matthew7:21-23" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.3.1 Matthew 7:21-23 IS NOT Teaching Legalism</a>

Jesus warning on the sermon on the mount taught that many would come to him in the last days saying &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; these people come to Jesus fully assured that they belong to him, and he rejects them, thereby exposing their assurance as counterfeit. 

Many people teach this incorrectly by telling people that they must perform some action to merit or earn their way into Heaven... <span style="color:#009933;">The context</span> shows that not only is this about <span style="color:#009933;">fruit-bearing (Mt 7:15-20)</span>, but it's also <span style="color:OrangeRed;">against legalism!</span> Ive color coded fruit bearing green and legalism red. Let's examine the verse:

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">21</sup> ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô <span style="color:#009933;">will enter the kingdom of heaven</span>, but <span style="color:#009933;">the one who does the will of my Father</span> who is in heaven. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">On that day many will say to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,</span> <span style="color:OrangeRed;">did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?</span>‚Äô <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;">And then will I declare to them, ‚ÄòI never [knew](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/#foreknew) you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.‚Äô</span> &mdash; Matthew 7:21-23

Here we can identify three types of individuals exhibiting assent to facts (notitia and assensus) but not "trust and reliance" (fiducia) that defines genuine saving faith.

1. <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;**did we not** prophesy in your name&rdquo;</span>
2. <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;and cast out demons in your name&rdquo;</span>
3. <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;and do many mighty **works** in your name?&rdquo;</span>

These all seem to me, to be legalistic pleas. They are all appealing to God, their works, as a reason why they should be admitted into heaven. Instead they should have had "trust and reliance" upon God's grace through faith only. This is why it's important to teach <span style="color:#009933;">&ldquo;resulting&rdquo; obedience</span> to God instead of <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;including&rdquo; obedience</span>. **You cannot merit your own salvation, and if you rely on your own efforts you're doomed.**

> Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague &mdash; [**Dr. J. I. Packer**](https://youtu.be/gExLXpPJDd8) (Ph.D., University of Oxford) [Concise Theology. Chapter 65 Legalism. p. 191.](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A)

> I believe <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009933;">saving faith will <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:#00cc44;">result</span> in obedience</span>... We must guard jealously the fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;">faith alone is what saves us, <span style="color:OrangeRed">not faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red">plus</span> obedience</span></span>. ... No historic Protestant confession says that saving faith includes obedience. &mdash; [Dr. Wayne Grudem (Ph.D., University of Cambridge; D.D., Westminster)](https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag)

<a name="James2:14-26" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.3.2 James 2:14-26 IS NOT Teaching Legalism</a>

&ldquo;*faith without works is dead*&rdquo; is not speaking about things you must do to be saved, it's speaking about things you will do if your faith is genuine (already saved).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if **someone** says he has faith but does not have works? <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">Can that faith <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">save him</span>?</span> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and filled,‚Äù without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">17</sup> So also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">faith by itself, if it does not have works, <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:14-17 ESV

Understanding James 2:24 is the difference between having sound doctrine, being legalist, or being antinomian. [Sproul](https://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q?si=jId5EfSDUTEhMmMS&t=71) actually explains this really well.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">20</sup> Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">24</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">You see that a person is justified by works and <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red">not by faith alone</span>.</span> ... <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also <span style="font-weight:bold;color:GoldenRod;">faith apart from works <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Gold;">is dead</span></span>. &mdash; James 2:20,24,26 ESV

If the Bible is to work together, Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28 & James 2:24 must be reconciled together. We accomplish this by observing, carefully, the context. In verses where the Apostle Paul is teaching that we're no longer under the law of moses<sup style="font-weight:bold;">Point 1</sup>, he is teaching that justification in the sight of God is by faith only; whereas, James in James 2:24 is speaking of Justification in the sight of men<sup style="font-weight:bold;">Points 2-6</sup>, the fruits of the faith, Godly dispositions of love, the good deeds and services that spring forth from a true and lively faith.

1. Verses against legalism (Eph 2:8-10; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28)
2. Verses against antinomianism (1 Jn 3:6-10; 5:18; Jd 4 NET; Ro 6:1-2,15; 3:8,31; Heb 10:26-31; 6:4-6; Lk 9:62)
3. Verses for obedience after salvation (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10; 1 Jn 2:3-6; 5:3-4)
4. Verses for Godly dispositions of Love (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:10; 4:8,20; Jn 13:34-35)
5. Verses for Godly and Holy lives (Heb 12:14; 1 Tim 6:3-4; 2 Tim 3:12; Titus 2:11-12; Gal 5:22-23)
6. Verses for good works after salvation (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10)

> When James says that faith without works is dead (i.e. a corpse), he is
using the word faith in the limited sense of notitia plus assensus, which is
how those he addresses were using it. When he says that one is justified by
what one does, not by faith alone, he means by ‚Äòjustified‚Äô ‚Äòproved genuine;
vindicated from the suspicion of being a hypocrite and a fraud‚Äô. James is
making the point that barren orthodoxy saves no-one (Jas. 2:14‚Äì26). Paul
would have agreed, and James‚Äôs whole letter shows him agreeing with Paul
that faith must change one‚Äôs life. Paul denounces the idea of salvation by
dead works; James rejects salvation by dead faith. &mdash; <a href="#packer-on-works">Packer on works.</a>

<a name="Romans2:7,13" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.3.3 Romans 2:7,13 IS NOT Teaching Legalism</a>

<!-- This one is another instance of legalists taking things out of context. Upon first inspection and cherry picking of the verse it would seem like a strong case, but when one looks at the overall message in context we can see that Christ is explaining that  -->

All works mentioned in the NT should be viewed through the lens of <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo;</span> fruit-bearing, not meritorious works righteousness. Since the Bible is very explicit about being justified by faith alone (Eph 2:8-10; Rom. 3:28). This reminds me of Mt 5:17 where the gist of the message is that we need Christ to be the perfect the archetypal law-keeper because we simply cannot, we are [totally depraved](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/total-depravity/) and unable to merit our own salvation (Isaiah 64:6 NLT).

> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed">eternal life to those who by perseverance in good works</span> seek glory and honor and immortality &mdash; Romans 2:7 NET

> For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed">the doers of the law who will be justified</span>. &mdash; Romans 2:13 ESV

<!-- > Are just - Are justified before God, or are personally holy. Or, in other words, simply hearing the Law is not meeting all its requirements, and making people holy. If they expected to be saved by the Law, it required something more than merely to hear it. It demanded perfect obedience. &mdash; [Barnes' Notes on the Bible](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/romans/2-13.htm) -->

The New Oxford Annotated Bible, Fifth (NRSV) has a very revealing thing to say about this verse.

> **13**: The statement that it is the doers of the law who will be justified serves as **a building block in Paul‚Äôs argument toward his central conviction that all have sinned and consequently justification comes only as God‚Äôs gift through faith (Ro 3.23-25).** &mdash; New Oxford Annotated Bible (Fifth) on Romans 2:13 NRSV. Over 50 years of students, and professors, relying on The New Oxford Annotated Bible as an unparalleled authority. 

<a name="James1:22" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">1.3.4 James 1:22 IS NOT Teaching Legalism</a>

All works mentioned in the NT should be viewed through the lens of <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo;</span> fruit-bearing, not meritorious works righteousness. The cults will attempt to teach you <span style="color:Red;">&ldquo;*included*&rdquo;</span> fruits, or <span style="color:Red">&ldquo;*plus works*&rdquo;</span>, but the Bible is very clear that these are <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo;</span> works that come after you're already saved as an evidence of genuine saving faith.

<!-- > But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves.
>> But don‚Äôt just listen to God‚Äôs word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves.
> &mdash; James 1:22 NET, NLT (Parallel) -->

> But **be doers** of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
>> But don‚Äôt just listen to God‚Äôs word. **You must do what it says.** Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves.
> &mdash; James 1:22 ESV, NLT (Parallel)

It will also help you to make the distinction between justification (which is by faith alone Eph 2:8-10; Rom 3:28), and assurance of salvation which is predicated upon an evidence-based faith (1Jn 2:3-6 NLT) &ldquo;*we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.*... *That is how we know we are living in him.*&rdquo;

> **Biblical faith is evidence-based.**... **Real faith in Christ shows itself by its fruit in the lives of those who profess it.** It is not a superficial thing. ... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*. p. 136, 218, 313.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/practicing-sin/#lennox)

Evidence is something that happens after-the-fact, after we're justified by faith alone. Then you can inspect for sanctification, which is a <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo;</span> fruit, not an <span style="color:Red;">&ldquo;*included*&rdquo;</span> work. You cannot add to or improve upon the Cross. The Cross is sufficent.

<a name="antinomianism" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">2. The Heresy Of Antinomianism</a>

Jude calls the church to defend the truth aggressively against this infiltration. Pay careful attention to the striking condemnation from Jude in this passage. The main points being the identifying points. The individuals who are marked out for condemnation meet the following criteria: 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">4</sup> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you‚Äîmen who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe‚Äî<span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;"><span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">ungodly men</span> who have turned the grace of our God into a <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">license for evil</span></span> and who <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;;">deny our only <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Master and Lord</span>, Jesus Christ</span>. &mdash; Jude 1:4 NET

They pervert, twist, and distort the gospel, falsely teaching that our God's grace allows them to live immoral lives. The NET Bible nails it with the phrase *"turned the grace of our God into **a license for evil**."* Greek [‚Äúdebauchery.‚Äù](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%204&version=NET) This is the same word Peter uses to predict what the false teachers will be like (2 Pet 2:2, 7, 18). 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But false prophets arose among the people, just as <span style="font-weight:bold;">there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">even to the point of denying the <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">Master</span> who bought them</span>. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> And <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">many will follow their <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:Red;">debauched lifestyles</span></span>. Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. &mdash; [2 Peter 2:1-2 NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A1-2&version=NET)

The phrase *"deny Jesus as Master and Lord"* is eerily reminiscent of modern neotheologies of today. They use the gospel to teach that grace is an excuse for ungodly living (cf. Rom. 3:8; 6:1, 15; 2 Pet. 3:15‚Äì16). Some even claiming you don't need to accept Jesus as Master & Lord to be saved!

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> What shall we say then? <span style="font-weight:bold;">Are we to remain in sin</span> so that grace may increase? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">Absolutely not!</span> How can we who died to sin still live in it? &mdash; Romans 6:1-2 NET

<!-- The Bible describes these ungodly men as worming (Jude 4 NLT) their way into churches (i.e. subversive) to preach and teach destructive heresies, even to the point of denying the Master who bought them. They lead and apparently teach debauched lifestyles, they commercialize Christianity like many of the false health & wealth prosperity gospel teachers. -->


Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically. A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (John 15:1-17). If a tree was genuinely alive it would bear fruit. It's the fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23). If the fruit isn‚Äôt growing the root is dead (Mt 3:8,10; Jn 15:8; Jas 2:17).

<!-- > Whoever says ‚ÄúI know him‚Äù but does not keep <span style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;color:Red;">his commandments</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">is a liar, and the truth is not in him</span>, &mdash; 1 John 2:4 ESV -->

> 3 And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. 4 <span style="font-weight:bold;color:OrangeRed;">If someone claims, ‚ÄúI know God,‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt obey God‚Äôs commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth.</span> 5 But those who obey God‚Äôs word truly show how completely they love him. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:ForestGreen;">That is how we know we are living in him.</span> 6 Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did. &mdash; 1 John 2:3-6 NLT

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em">This message is not legalistic</span>, it is not speaking of meriting or earning your salvation. This is speaking of the fruit of genuine saving faith. This is also not speaking of perfection (1Jn 2:1-3). It is simply saying, that if your faith is not superficial, your life will bear fruit (Gal 5:22-23; John 15:1-17). Justification is by faith alone (Rom. 3:28; Eph 2:8-10), but the faith that saves is never alone in the person justified (Jn 14:15,21).

Saving faith <span style="color:OrangeRed;">&ldquo;**does not include**&rdquo;</span> obedience, saving faith <span style="color:ForestGreen;">&ldquo;**results in**&rdquo;</span> obedience. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to facts but instead a trust and reliance in Christ.

Practice in this sense means a lifelong continual pattern. It speaks of the pursuit of a lifestyle of indulgent sin. This does not mean that you will not have sin or that you will be perfect, in fact you may struggle with sin, make mistakes, and even backslide. A true Christian will undergo decreasing patterns of sin (1 John 3:8‚Äì9; cf. Rom. 6:14‚Äì18) in their progressive sanctification. They will not remain in their old way of life (2 Cor. 5:17; 1Jn 3:31).

> 66\. ANTINOMIANISM<br>
WE ARE NOT SET FREE TO SIN
>
>>Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right
is righteous, just as he [Christ] is righteous.
1 John 3:7
>
Antinomianism, which means being ‚Äòanti-law‚Äô, is a name for several views
that have denied that God‚Äôs law in Scripture should directly control the
Christian‚Äôs life.
>
**Dualistic antinomianism** appears in the Gnostic heretics against whom
Jude and Peter wrote (Jude 4‚Äì19; 2 Pet. 2). This view sees salvation as for
the soul only, and bodily behaviour as irrelevant both to God‚Äôs interest and
to the soul‚Äôs health, so one may behave riotously and it will not matter.
>
**Spirit-centred antinomianism** puts such trust in the Holy Spirit‚Äôs inward
prompting as to deny any need to be taught by the law how to live. Freedom
from the law as a way of salvation is assumed to bring with it freedom from
the law as a guide to conduct. In the first hundred and fifty years of the
Reformation era this kind of antinomianism often threatened, and Paul‚Äôs
insistence that a truly spiritual person acknowledges the authority of God‚Äôs
Word through Christ‚Äôs apostles (1 Cor. 14:37; cf. 7:40) suggests that the
Spirit-obsessed Corinthian church was in the grip of the same mindset.
>
**Christ-centred antinomianism** argues that God sees no sin in believers,
because they are in Christ, who kept the law for them, and therefore what
they actually do makes no difference, provided that they keep believing.
But 1 John 1:8 ‚Äì 2:1 (expounding 1:7) and 3:4‚Äì10 point in a different
direction, showing that it is not possible to be in Christ and at the same time to embrace sin as a way of life.
>
**Dispensational antinomianism** holds that keeping the moral law is at no
stage necessary for Christians, since we live under a dispensation of grace,
not of law. Romans 3:31 and 1 Corinthians 6:9‚Äì11 clearly show, however,
that law-keeping is a continuing obligation for Christians. ‚ÄòI am not free
from God‚Äôs law but am under Christ‚Äôs law,‚Äô says Paul (1 Cor. 9:21).
>
**Dialectical antinomianism**, as in Barth and Brunner, denies that biblical
law is God‚Äôs direct command and affirms that the Bible‚Äôs imperative
statements trigger the Word of the Spirit, which when it comes may or may
not correspond exactly to what is written. The inadequacy of the neoorthodox view of biblical authority, which explains the inspiration of
Scripture in terms of the Bible‚Äôs instrumentality as a channel for God‚Äôs
present-day utterances to his people, is evident here.
>
**Situationist antinomianism** says that a motive and intention of love is all
that God now requires of Christians, and the commands of the Decalogue
and other ethical parts of Scripture, for all that they are ascribed to God
directly, are mere rules of thumb for loving, rules that love may at any time
disregard. But Romans 13:8‚Äì10, to which this view appeals, teaches that
without love as a motive these specific commands cannot be fulfilled. Once
more an unacceptably weak view of Scripture surfaces.
>
It must be stressed that the moral law, as crystallized in the Decalogue
and opened up in the ethical teaching of both Testaments, is one coherent
law, given to be a code of practice for God‚Äôs people in every age. In
addition, repentance means resolving henceforth to seek God‚Äôs help in
keeping that law. The Spirit is given to empower law-keeping and make us
more and more like Christ, the archetypal law-keeper (Matt. 5:17). This
law-keeping is in fact the fulfilling of our human nature, and Scripture
holds out no hope of salvation for any who, whatever their profession of
faith, do not seek to turn from sin to righteousness (1 Cor. 6:9‚Äì11; Rev.
21:8).

Bearing fruit happens naturally for living trees, both in nature and metaphorically. A branch cannot bear fruit by itself (John 15:1-17). If a tree was genuinely alive it would bear fruit. It's the fruit of the Spirit, not the fruit of human decision (Gal 5:22-23). If the fruit isn‚Äôt growing the root is dead (Mt 3:8,10; Jn 15:8; Jas 2:17).

> 59\. WORKS<br>
GOOD WORKS ARE AN EXPRESSION OF FAITH
>
>>You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.
James 2:24
>
In the New Testament, faith (believing trust, or trustful belief, based on testimony received as from God) is crucially important, for it is the means or instrumental cause of salvation. It is by faith that Christians are justified before God (Rom. 3:26; 4:1‚Äì5; Gal. 2:16), live their lives (literally ‚Äòwalk‚Äô, 2 Cor. 5:7), and sustain their hope (Heb. 10:35 ‚Äì 12:3).
>
Faith cannot be defined in subjective terms, as a confident and
optimistic mindset, or in passive terms, as acquiescent orthodoxy or
confidence in God without commitment to God. Faith is an object-oriented
response, shaped by that which is trusted, namely God himself, God‚Äôs
promises, and Jesus Christ, all as set forth in the Scriptures. And faith is a
whole-souled response, involving mind, heart, will, and affections. Older
Reformed theology analysed faith as notitia (‚Äòknowledge‚Äô, i.e. acquaintance
with the content of the gospel), plus assensus (‚Äòagreement‚Äô, i.e. recognition
that the gospel is true), plus fiducia (‚Äòtrust and reliance‚Äô, i.e. personal
dependence on the grace of Father, Son, and Spirit for salvation, with
thankful cessation of all attempts to save oneself by establishing one‚Äôs own
righteousness: Rom. 4:5; 10:3). Without fiducia there is no faith, but
without notitia and assensus there can be no fiducia (Rom. 10:14).
>
God‚Äôs gift of faith is a fruit of applicatory illumination by the Holy
Spirit, and it ordinarily has in it some measure of conscious-assurance
through the witnessing of the Spirit (Rom. 8:15‚Äì17). Calvin defined faith as
‚Äòa firm and sure knowledge of the divine favour towards us, founded on the
truth of a free promise in Christ, and revealed to our minds and sealed on
our hearts by the Holy Spirit.‚Äô **Justification by works (things we have done) is the heresy of legalism. Justification, as Luther insisted, is by faith only (‚Äòfaith apart from observing the law‚Äô, Rom. 3:28), because it is in Christ and by Christ only, and depends on what he is as distinct from what we are.** But if ‚Äògood works‚Äô (activities of serving God and others) do not follow from our profession of faith, we are as yet believing only from the head, not from the heart: in other words, justifying faith (fiducia) is not yet ours. The truth is that, though we are justified by faith alone, the faith that justifies is never alone. It produces moral fruit; it expresses itself ‚Äòthrough love‚Äô (Gal. 5:6); it transforms one‚Äôs way of living; it begets virtue. This is not only because holiness is commanded, but also because the regenerate heart, of which fiducia is the expression, desires holiness and can find full contentment only in seeking it.
>
When James says that faith without works is dead (i.e. a corpse), he is
using the word faith in the limited sense of notitia plus assensus, which is
how those he addresses were using it. When he says that one is justified by
what one does, not by faith alone, he means by ‚Äòjustified‚Äô ‚Äòproved genuine;
vindicated from the suspicion of being a hypocrite and a fraud‚Äô. James is
making the point that barren orthodoxy saves no-one (Jas. 2:14‚Äì26). Paul
would have agreed, and James‚Äôs whole letter shows him agreeing with Paul
that faith must change one‚Äôs life. Paul denounces the idea of salvation by
dead works; James rejects salvation by dead faith.
> 
Though the believer‚Äôs works do not merit salvation and always have
something imperfect about them (Rom. 7:13‚Äì20; Gal. 5:17), in their
character as expressions of the love and fidelity that faith calls forth they
are the basis on which God promises rewards in heaven (Phil. 3:12‚Äì14; 2
Tim. 4:7‚Äì8). For God thus to reward us according to our works is, as
Augustine noted, his gracious crowning of his own gracious gifts.
