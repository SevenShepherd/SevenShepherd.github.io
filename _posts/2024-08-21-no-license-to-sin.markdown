<!-- They flaunt their rebellion around you because the presence of Christ in you exposes their corruption. -->

They cloak their rebellion by abusing grace, wielding it as a license to sin. Their defiance festers in our presence because **the light of Christ within us exposes their darkness** (Ac 26:18,20). It's His authority in us that disturbs them, a silent condemnation they can neither ignore nor escape. It's not us they are irritated by, it's Christ himself (Jn 7:7).

<!-- like hydrogen peroxide to a dirty wound -->

> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you—men who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe—**ungodly men who have turned the grace of our God into a license for evil** and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. &mdash; Jude 1:4

Only those whom God indwells repent and turn away from their sins (Ac 3:19). Only those who have not fooled themselves (2Cor. 13:5). Only those who truly love God (Jn 14:15). Sanctification and fruit bearing (Jn 15:5) are the result of genuine faith and the work of the Holy Spirit (1Cor 3:6-7). In practice (1Jn 3:4-10) not perfection. 

Where is his work in you?
