title: "✝️ As Jude 4 foretold, they abuse the precious grace of our God, twisting and cheapening it into a license to sin. They flaunt their rebellion around us because the the light of Christ within us exposes their darkness."

<!-- When false Christians sin under the guise of grace, they expose their rebellion against the God who empowers true believers, fulfilling the prophecy of Jude 4. -->

<!-- They brazenly display their rebellion because the presence of Christ within us lays bare their corruption, provoking them to rage against His authority. -->

<!-- They flaunt their rebellion around us because the presence of Christ in us exposes their corruption. They rage against His authority. -->

False converts cloak their rebellion by abusing the precious grace of our God, twisting and cheapening it into a license to sin. Their defiance is frustrated in our presence because **the light of Christ within us exposes their darkness** (Ac 26:18,20). It's His authority in us that disturbs them, a silent condemnation they can neither ignore nor escape. It's not us they are irritated by, it's Christ himself (Jn 7:7).

> For certain men have secretly slipped in among you—men who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe—**ungodly men who have turned the grace of our God into a license for evil** and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. &mdash; Jude 1:4

Only those whom God indwells are given the dispositions of godly sorrow that characterize repentance (2Cor. 7:10) and are imbued with a deep-seated desire to turn away from their sins (Ac 3:19). Only those who have not fooled themselves (1Jn 2:3-6). Only those who truly love God (Jn 14:15). Sanctification and fruit bearing (Jn 15:5) are the result of genuine saving faith (2Cor. 13:5) and the work of the Holy Spirit (1Cor 3:6-7). In practice (1Jn 3:4-10) not perfection. 

Justification is by faith alone (Rom 3:28), but a faith that does not grow the fruit of obedience **by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit**, is not true faith; it is a dead faith, and James rejects salvation by a dead and superficial faith (James 2:14-26). Genuine faith always *&ldquo;results&rdquo;* in the fruits of the faith (Ga 5:22-23 NLT; Jn 15:4-5; 1Cor 3:6-7), **denying this, denies His transformative power**.
