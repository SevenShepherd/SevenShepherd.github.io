<!-- <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:2em;">Hello</span> -->

When Solomon prayed for wisdom, he asked for an understanding mind able to discern between good and evil (bad). This will be a small article on the necessity of training up a child in the way they ought to go. If you choose another path, your child will likely end up hurting themselves or others later in life.

> Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, **that I may discern between good and evil**, for who is able to govern this your great people?” &mdash; 1 Kings 3:9 ESV

> Direct your children onto the right path, and when they are older, they will not leave it. &mdash; Proverbs 22:6

> Those who spare the rod of discipline **hate their children**. Those who love their children care enough to discipline them. &mdash; Proverbs 13:24

> Don’t fail to discipline your children. The rod of punishment won’t kill them. **Physical discipline** may well **save them from death**. &mdash; Proverbs 23:13-14

> To discipline a child **produces wisdom**, but a mother is disgraced by an undisciplined child. &mdash; Proverbs 29:15

> A youngster’s heart is filled with foolishness, but **physical discipline** will drive it far away. &mdash; Proverbs 22:15

> Discipline your children **while there is hope**. **Otherwise you will ruin their lives.** &mdash; Proverbs 19:18

> A Wife of Noble Character
10 [a]Who can find a virtuous and capable wife?
    She is more precious than rubies.
11 Her husband can trust her,
    and she will greatly enrich his life.
12 She brings him good, not harm,
    all the days of her life.
>
13 She finds wool and flax
    and busily spins it.
14 She is like a merchant’s ship,
    bringing her food from afar.
15 She gets up before dawn to prepare breakfast for her household
    and plan the day’s work for her servant girls.
>
16 She goes to inspect a field and buys it;
    with her earnings she plants a vineyard.
17 She is energetic and strong,
    a hard worker.
18 She makes sure her dealings are profitable;
    her lamp burns late into the night.
>
19 Her hands are busy spinning thread,
    her fingers twisting fiber.
20 She extends a helping hand to the poor
    and opens her arms to the needy.
21 She has no fear of winter for her household,
    for everyone has warm[b] clothes.
>
22 She makes her own bedspreads.
    She dresses in fine linen and purple gowns.
23 Her husband is well known at the city gates,
    where he sits with the other civic leaders.
24 She makes belted linen garments
    and sashes to sell to the merchants.
>
25 She is clothed with strength and dignity,
    and she laughs without fear of the future.
26 When she speaks, her words are wise,
    and she gives instructions with kindness.
27 She carefully watches everything in her household
    and suffers nothing from laziness.
>
28 Her children stand and bless her.
    Her husband praises her:
29 “There are many virtuous and capable women in the world,
    but you surpass them all!”
>
30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last;
    but a woman who fears the Lord will be greatly praised.
31 Reward her for all she has done.
    Let her deeds publicly declare her praise.
