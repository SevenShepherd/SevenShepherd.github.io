<!-- <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:2em;">Hello</span> -->

When Solomon prayed for wisdom, he asked for an understanding mind able to discern between good and evil (bad). This will be a small article on the necessity of training up a child in the way they ought to go. If you choose another path, your child will likely end up hurting themselves or others later in life.

> Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, **that I may discern between good and evil**, for who is able to govern this your great people?” &mdash; 1 Kings 3:9 ESV

> Direct your children onto the right path, and when they are older, they will not leave it. &mdash; Proverbs 22:6

> Those who spare the rod of discipline **hate their children**. Those who love their children care enough to discipline them. &mdash; Proverbs 13:24

> Don’t fail to discipline your children. The rod of punishment won’t kill them. **Physical discipline** may well **save them from death**. &mdash; Proverbs 23:13-14

> To discipline a child **produces wisdom**, but a mother is disgraced by an undisciplined child. &mdash; Proverbs 29:15

> A youngster’s heart is filled with foolishness, but **physical discipline** will drive it far away. &mdash; Proverbs 22:15

> Discipline your children **while there is hope**. **Otherwise you will ruin their lives.** &mdash; Proverbs 19:18
