<a name="amyraldism" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">I. Moderate Calvinism</a>

Amyraldism, Amyraldianism, Moderate Calvinism, or "four-point" Calvinism is a modified form of Calvinism which rejects limited atonement and replaces it with unlimited atonement, also known as hypothetical universalism. It is an attempt to reconcile the doctrines of predestination and election with the belief in a libertarian version of free will instead of the freedom of inclination of the Calvinists.

> Moderate Calvinists and moderate Arminians, who represent the vast majority of Christendom, have much in common against the extremes in the opposing two views. Indeed, John Wesley himself (a moderate Arminian) said he was only a “hair’s breadth from Calvin.” And as is later demonstrated in appendix 2, Calvin himself rejected some things held in later extreme Calvinism (e.g., limited atonement). &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler (Ph.D., Philosophy, Pennsylvania; M.A., Theology, Wheaton)

<a name="distinctives" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">II. Distinctives</a>


The following is a description of the difference between what Norman Geisler calls extreme Calvinism (hyper-calvinism), which is not to be confused with what he calls strong Calvinism (17th century scholastic Calvinism), and moderate Calvinism (Amyraldism).

|The Five Points|Extreme Calvinism|Moderate Calvinism|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**T**otal Depravity|Intensive (Destructive)|Extensive (Corruptive)|
|**U**nconditional Election|No condition for God or man|No condition for God; One condition for man (faith)|
|**L**imited Atonement|Limited in extent (only for the elect)|Limited in result (but for all men)|
|**I**rresistible Grace|In compulsive sense (against man's will)|In persuasive sense (in accordance with man's will)|
|**P**erserverence of The Saints|No saint will die in sin|No saint will ever be lost (even if he dies in sin)|

> We have already evaluated the extreme Calvinists’ understanding of T-U-L-I-P (in chapters 4 and 5). Here we simply note how a moderate Calvinist understands these five Calvinistic doctrines. 
>
T—Total depravity is amply supported by Scripture in the moderate Calvinist sense. All the Scriptures used by extreme Calvinists are accepted by moderate Calvinists; the only difference is that moderates insist that being “dead” in sin does not mean that unsaved people cannot understand and receive the truth of the gospel as the Spirit of God works on their hearts. That is, it does not in effect erase the image of God (but only ef aces it). 
>
U—Unconditional election is also held by moderate Calvinists. It is unconditional from the standpoint of the Giver, even though there is one condition for the receiver—faith. 156 
>
L—Even limited atonement is affirmed by moderate Calvinists in the sense that it is limited in its application. That is, although redemption was purchased for all and is available to all, nonetheless, it will only be applied to those whom God chose from all eternity—the elect. 
>
I—Irresistible grace is held by moderate Calvinists. Irresistible grace is exercised on all who are willing, as was stated in chapter 5. That is, anyone who is receptive to God’s work in his heart will be overwhelmed by His grace.
>
P—Perseverance of the saints, too, is an essential part of moderate Calvinism. It affirms that all regenerate (justified) people eventually will be saved. This is supported by numerous Scriptures.

<a name="demarest3.1" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.1 As delineated by Dr. Bruce Demarest</a>

> In sum, regarding the question, For whom did Christ die? we find biblical warrant for dividing the question into God’s purpose regarding the provision of the Atonement and his purpose concerning the application thereof. **Scripture leads us to conclude that God loves all people he created and that Christ died to provide salvation for all.** The provision side of the Atonement is part of the general will of God that must be preached to all. But beyond this, the Father loves the “sheep” with a special love,<sup>117</sup> and in the divine will the Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s death to the “sheep,” or the elect. The application side of the Atonement is part of the special will of God shared with those who come to faith. This conclusion—that Christ died to make atonement for all to the end that its benefits would be applied to the elect—coheres with the perspective of <span style="color:#3EA055;">**Sublapsarian Calvinism** [Moderate Calvinism]</span>. <span style="color:darkred;">**It differs from the Supralapsarian** [Hyper-Calvinism]</span> and <span style="color:#FBB917;">**Infralapsarian schemes** [Scholastic Calvinism]</span>, which teach that Christ died to make provision only for the sins of the elect. And <span style="color:darkblue;">**it differs from the Arminian scheme** [Wesleyan]</span>  of decrees, which states that God willed the application of the Atonement to all, but that the divine purpose was frustrated by human resistance. A.H. Strong reflected the biblical perspective when he wrote, “Not the atonement therefore is limited, but the application through the work of the Holy Spirit.”<sup>118</sup> ... <span style="color:#3EA055;">The position outlined is not Arminianism (as some allege) but a viewpoint close to that of Calvin himself</span> ... &mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest (Ph.D., Manchester), The Cross and Salvation. p. 193.

<a name="geisler3.2" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 As delineated by Dr. Norman Geisler</a>

> The term supralapsarian is from the Latin supra (above) and lapsus (fall), meaning that God’s decree of election (predestination) is considered by supralapsarians to be above, or logically prior to, His decree to permit the Fall. Since infra means “below,” the infralapsarians consider God’s decree of election to be beneath, or logically after, His decree to permit the Fall. The sublapsarians (Amyraldians) <sup>9</sup> are similar to the infralapsarians, except they place God’s order to provide salvation before His order to elect (see Chafer, ST, 2.105). Wesleyans adhere to the same basic order as infralapsarians, except they hold that God’s election is based on His foreknowledge rather than simply in accord with it. Hence, for Wesleyans (Arminians), God’s decree is conditional instead of unconditional (which is maintained by the three Calvinistic views).

<span style="color:darkred;">Supralapsarians are hypter-Calvinists, being double-predestinarians.</span> <sup>10</sup> <span style="color:#FBB917;">Infralapsarians are strong Calvinists but are not double-predestinarians.</span> <span style="color:#3EA055;">Sublapsarians (Amyraldians) are moderate Calvinists, holding to unlimited atonement</span>.

<a name="OrdoSalutis" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">IV. Ordo Salutis</a>

The Ordo Salutis reads similarly to [Scholastic Calvinism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-calvinist/), but regeneration tends to be moved from before faith, to after. Some might argue that this makes this theology lose its status as monergistic, but that may not be the case as it still upholds unconditional election. Although, it's worth noting that Norman Geisler, who is himself a moderate calvinist, advocates for a form of synergism. Ordo Salutis provided by Dr. Bruce Demarest.<a href="#demarest_cite"><sup>1</sup></a>

> Evangelicals in the broadly Reformed tradition insist that the whole of salvation, from eternity past to eternity future, proceeds from the grace of God, centers on Christ, and is wrought by the power of the Holy Spirit. &mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest

The following is the Ordo Salutis for broadly reformed evangelicals. Amyraldians may have a further modified Ordo Salutis, but it should be very similar.

1. **Election**
    - Without regard for foreseen human faith or good works, God in eternity past chose from among the lot of fallen humanity some to inherit eternal life.
2. **Effectual calling**
    - The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.
3. **Belief in the Gospel**
    - Quickened by the Spirit, the minds of the elect are persuaded of the truths of the Gospel of God’s grace.
4. **Repentance**
    - Likewise enabled by the Spirit the effectually called despise and turn away from all known sins.
5. **Trust in Christ**
    - The effectually called personally commit themselves to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their life.
6. **Regeneration**
    - God creates in justified believers new life, defined as the radical reorientation of the dispositions and affections toward God.
7. **Union with Christ**
    - The Spirit unites newly born saints with Jesus Christ in a vital, spiritual, and indissoluble union. The NT describes this experiential reality by the familiar “in Christ” motif.
8. **Justification**
    - God in turn reckons believing sinners righteous in his sight and bestows upon them the gift of eternal life.
9. **Sanctification**
    - By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.
10. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - By the application of divine power, God faithfully preserves regenerate saints in faith and hope unto the attainment of eternal life.
11. **Glorification**
    - God perfects the final and complete redemption of the believer—body, soul, and spirit—at the Parousia of the Lord Jesus Christ.

- <a name="martin5.3.1" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.2em;">5.3.1 Dr. Walter Martin Quoted</a>

    > Walter Martin, founder of the Christian Research Institute, observes: “John the Apostle tells us that Christ gave His life as a propitiation for **our sin (i.e., the elect)**, though not for ours only but for the sins of the **whole world (1 John 2:2)**....[People] cannot evade John’s usage of ‘whole’ (Greek: holos). In the same context the apostle quite cogently points out that ‘the whole (holos) world lies in wickedness’ or, more properly, ‘in the lap of the wicked one’ (1 John 5:19, literal translation). If we assume that ‘whole’ applies only to the chosen or elect of God, then the ‘whole world does not ‘lie in the lap of the wicked one.’ This, of course, all reject.”


<a name="lennox5.4" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">5.4 Dr. John C. Lennox Dispatches Limited Atonement</a>

Dr. John C. Lennox, while **not an Amyraldian** himself and choosing to go **systemless**, also contributes many vital points in his book &ldquo;[*Determined to Believe?*]()&rdquo; if you want something more in-depth and expansive.

> All of this invalidates the L of TULIP – “limited atonement” –
the view that Christ did not actually die for all but only for the “elect”.
In fact, not only Luther but many of the other reformers, including
Calvin, did not subscribe to limited atonement... this view of the atonement
was not even introduced until the second or third generation of
Reformers... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*]() p. 179.

<a name="carson5.5" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">5.5 Dr. Carson's Multiple-Intentions</a>

Read &ldquo;*The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God*&rdquo; pp. 73-78 (Amyraldian view, 73-74). Or check out this [article](http://www.walkingwithgiants.net/people/carson-d-a/carson-on-the-extent-of-the-atonement/) about it.

While Carson &ldquo;lumps together&rdquo; the Arminian and the Amyraldian in this book, he is actually arguing for a ‘multiple-intentions’ view of the atonement, such as is advocated by Amyraldians (Moderate Calvinists), this is called hypothetical universalism.

> **B. The Love of God and the Intent of the Atonement**
>
Here I wish to see if the approaches we have been following with respect to the love of God may shed some light on another area connected with the sovereignty of God—the purpose of the Atonement.
>
The label “limited atonement” is singularly unfortunate for two reasons. First, it is a defensive, restrictive expression: here is atonement, and then someone wants to limit it. The notion of limiting something as glorious as the Atonement is intrinsically offensive. Second, even when inspected more coolly, “limited
atonement” is objectively misleading. Every view of the Atonement “limits” it in some way, save for the view of the unqualified universalist. For example, the Arminian limits the Atonement by regarding it as merely potential for everyone; the Calvinist regards the Atonement as definite and effective (i.e., those for whom Christ died will certainly be saved), but limits this effectiveness to the elect; **the Amyraldian limits the Atonement in much the same way as the Arminian, even though the undergirding structures are different**.
>
It may be less prejudicial, therefore, to distinguish general atonement and definite atonement, rather than unlimited atonement and limited atonement. The Arminian (and the **Amyraldian**, whom I shall lump together for the sake of this discussion) **holds that the Atonement is general, i.e., sufficient for all, available to all, on condition of faith**; the Calvinist holds that the Atonement is definite, i.e., intended by God to be effective for the elect.
> 
At least part of the argument in favor of definite atonement runs as follows. Let us grant, for the sake of argument, the truth of election.<sup>1</sup> That is one point where this discussion intersects with what was said in the third chapter about God’s sovereignty and his electing love. In that case the question may be framed in this way: When God sent his Son to the cross, did he think of the effect of the cross with respect to his elect differently from the way he thought of the effect of the cross with respect to all others? If one answers negatively, it is very difficult to see that one is really holding to a doctrine of election at all; if one answers positively, then one has veered toward some notion of definite atonement. The definiteness of the Atonement turns rather more
on God’s intent in Christ’s cross work than in the mere extent of its significance.
>
But the issue is not merely one of logic dependent on election. Those who defend definite atonement cite texts. Jesus will save his people from their sins (Matt. 1:21)—not everyone. Christ gave himself “for us,” i.e., for us the people of the new covenant (Tit. 2:14), “to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.” Moreover, in his death Christ did not merely make adequate provision for the elect, but he actually achieved the desired result (Rom. 5:6-10; Eph. 2:15-16). The Son of Man came to give his life a ransom “for many” (Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45; cf. Isa. 53:10-12). Christ “loved the church and gave himself up for her” (Eph. 5:25).

--

> Surely it is best not to introduce disjunctions where God himself has not introduced them. **If one holds that the Atonement is sufficient for all and effective for the elect, then both sets of texts and concerns are accommodated.** As far as I can see, a text such as 1 John 2:2 states something about the potential breadth of the Atonement. As I understand the historical context... **It was not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world.** The context, then, understands this to mean something like “potentially for all without distinction” rather than “effectively for all without exception”—for in the latter case all without exception must surely be saved, and John does not suppose that that will take place.

> **I argue, then, that both Arminians and Calvinists should rightly affirm that Christ died for all**, in the sense that Christ’s death was sufficient for all and that Scripture portrays God as inviting, commanding, and desiring the salvation of all, out of love(in the third sense developed in the first chapter). Further, all Christians ought also to confess that, in a slightly different sense,
Christ Jesus, in the intent of God, died effectively for the elect alone, in line with the way the Bible speaks of God’s special selecting love for the elect (in the fourth sense developed in the first chapter).
