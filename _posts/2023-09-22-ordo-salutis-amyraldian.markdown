<a name="amyraldism" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">I. Moderate Calvinism</a>

Amyraldism, Amyraldianism, Moderate Calvinism, or "four-point" Calvinism is a modified form of Calvinism which rejects limited atonement and replaces it with unlimited atonement, also known as hypothetical universalism. It is an attempt to reconcile the doctrines of predestination and election with the belief in a libertarian version of free will instead of the freedom of inclination of the Calvinists.

> Moderate Calvinists and moderate Arminians, who represent the vast majority of Christendom, have much in common against the extremes in the opposing two views. Indeed, John Wesley himself (a moderate Arminian) said he was only a “hair’s breadth from Calvin.” And as is later demonstrated in appendix 2, Calvin himself rejected some things held in later extreme Calvinism (e.g., limited atonement). &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler (Ph.D., Philosophy, Pennsylvania; M.A., Theology, Wheaton)


<!-- > 1 John 3:9 John affirmed that “no one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.” <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color:orangered;">This confirms</span> moderate <span style="color:orangered;">Calvinism</span>’s</span> view of eternal security for two reasons. First, anyone truly born of God cannot persist in evil. **If someone does, then he is not born of God.** That is, a Christian’s perseverance in avoiding continual, habitual sin is a proof of his salvation &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler, Systematic Theology Vol. 3 Sin & Salvation. Ch. 11. -->

<!-- > Since saving faith is an act of trust in and obedience to Jesus Christ regarding the gospel, it is evident from its very essence that **saving faith (which <span style="color:orangered;">involves repentance</span>) will naturally tend to produce good works**—a nominal, noncommittal, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">purely intellectual-type faith will not</span>. Therefore, whereas <span style="font-weight:bold;color:orangered;">we are saved by faith alone, saving faith is not alone</span> but is inclined to produce good works. &mdash; Dr. Norman Geisler -->

> All of this invalidates the L of TULIP – “limited atonement” –
the view that Christ did not actually die for all but only for the “elect”.
In fact, not only Luther but many of the other reformers, including
Calvin, did not subscribe to limited atonement... this view of the atonement
was not even introduced until the second or third generation of
Reformers... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*]() p. 179.

> Evangelicals in the broadly Reformed tradition insist that the whole of salvation, from eternity past to eternity future, proceeds from the grace of God, centers on Christ, and is wrought by the power of the Holy Spirit. &mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest



<!-- - [⚠️ Synergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/synergism/) / ✅ [Monergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/monergism/) I identify as evangelical in addition to being reformed; this places regeneration in it's proper place before faith. If you're evangelical, and placing regeneration after faith, you're by definition synergistic. I believe reformed evangelicals to be a safe option as long as it remains true to historic protestantism in it's nuances and theological conservatism (no, not politics). -->

The following is a description of the difference between what Norman Geisler calls extreme calvinism, which is not 17th century scholastic calvinism, but hyper-calvinism, and moderate calvinism which is what this article is about (amyraldism).

|The Five Points|Extreme Calvinism|Moderate Calvinism|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**T**otal Depravity|Intensive (Destructive)|Extensive (Corruptive)|
|**U**nconditional Election|No condition for God or man|No condition for God; One condition for man (faith)|
|**L**imited Atonement|Limited in extent (only for the elect)|Limited in result(but for all men)|
|**I**rresistible Grace|In compulsive sense (against man's will)|In persuasive sense (in accordance with man's will)|
|**P**erserverence of The Saints|No saint will die in sin|No saint will ever be lost (even if he dies in sin)|

> We have already evaluated the extreme Calvinists’ understanding of T-U-L-I-P (in chapters 4 and 5). Here we simply note how a moderate Calvinist understands these five Calvinistic doctrines. 
>
T—Total depravity is amply supported by Scripture in the moderate Calvinist sense. All the Scriptures used by extreme Calvinists are accepted by moderate Calvinists; the only difference is that moderates insist that being “dead” in sin does not mean that unsaved people cannot understand and receive the truth of the gospel as the Spirit of God works on their hearts. That is, it does not in effect erase the image of God (but only ef aces it). 
>
U—Unconditional election is also held by moderate Calvinists. It is unconditional from the standpoint of the Giver, even though there is one condition for the receiver—faith. 156 
>
L—Even limited atonement is affirmed by moderate Calvinists in the sense that it is limited in its application. That is, although redemption was purchased for all and is available to all, nonetheless, it will only be applied to those whom God chose from all eternity—the elect. 
>
I—Irresistible grace is held by moderate Calvinists. Irresistible grace is exercised on all who are willing, as was stated in chapter 5. That is, anyone who is receptive to God’s work in his heart will be overwhelmed by His grace.
>
P—Perseverance of the saints, too, is an essential part of moderate Calvinism. It affirms that all regenerate (justified) people eventually will be saved. This is supported by numerous Scriptures.

![The Order Of God's Decrees](/assets/images/decrees.png)

<a name="demarest3.1" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.1 As delineated by Dr. Bruce Demarest</a>

> In sum, regarding the question, For whom did Christ die? we find biblical warrant for dividing the question into God’s purpose regarding the provision of the Atonement and his purpose concerning the application thereof. **Scripture leads us to conclude that God loves all people he created and that Christ died to provide salvation for all.** The provision side of the Atonement is part of the general will of God that must be preached to all. But beyond this, the Father loves the “sheep” with a special love,<sup>117</sup> and in the divine will the Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s death to the “sheep,” or the elect. The application side of the Atonement is part of the special will of God shared with those who come to faith. This conclusion—that Christ died to make atonement for all to the end that its benefits would be applied to the elect—coheres with the perspective of **Sublapsarian Calvinism** <span style="color:#3EA055;">[Moderate Calvinism]</span>. **It differs from the Supralapsarian** <span style="color:darkred;">[Hyper-Calvinism]</span> and **Infralapsarian schemes** <span style="color:#FBB917;">[Scholastic Calvinism]</span>, which teach that Christ died to make provision only for the sins of the elect. And **it differs from the Arminian scheme** <span style="color:darkblue;">[Wesleyan]</span>  of decrees, which states that God willed the application of the Atonement to all, but that the divine purpose was frustrated by human resistance. A.H. Strong reflected the biblical perspective when he wrote, “Not the atonement therefore is limited, but the application through the work of the Holy Spirit.”<sup>118</sup> ... **The position outlined is not Arminianism (as some allege) but a viewpoint close to that of Calvin himself** ... &mdash; Dr. Bruce Demarest (Ph.D., Manchester), The Cross and Salvation. p. 193.

<a name="geisler3.2" href="#contents" style="font-size:1.6em;">3.2 As delineated by Dr. Norman Geisler</a>


> The term supralapsarian is from the Latin supra (above) and lapsus (fall), meaning that God’s decree of election (predestination) is considered by supralapsarians to be above, or logically prior to, His decree to permit the Fall. Since infra means “below,” the infralapsarians consider God’s decree of election to be beneath, or logically after, His decree to permit the Fall. The sublapsarians (Amyraldians) <sup>9</sup> are similar to the infralapsarians, except they place God’s order to provide salvation before His order to elect (see Chafer, ST, 2.105). Wesleyans adhere to the same basic order as infralapsarians, except they hold that God’s election is based on His foreknowledge rather than simply in accord with it. Hence, for Wesleyans (Arminians), God’s decree is conditional instead of unconditional (which is maintained by the three Calvinistic views).
>
Supralapsarians are hypter-Calvinists, being double-predestinarians. <sup>10</sup> Infralapsarians are strong Calvinists but are not double-predestinarians. Sublapsarians (Amyraldians) are moderate Calvinists, holding to unlimited atonement. Again, Wesleyans are Arminians, insisting that election is conditional, not unconditional. Wesleyans also do not believe in eternal security, <sup>11</sup> while adherents to the other views do.

<a name="OrdoSalutis" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;">IV. Ordo Salutis</a>

The Ordo Salutis reads similarly to [Scholastic Calvinism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-calvinist/), but regeneration tends to be moved from before faith, to after. Some might argue that this makes this theology lose its status as monergistic, but that may not be the case as it still upholds unconditional election. Although, it's worth noting that Norman Geisler, who is himself a moderate calvinist, advocates for a form of synergism. Ordo Salutis provided by Dr. Bruce Demarest.<a href="#demarest_cite"><sup>1</sup></a>

1. **Election**
    - Without regard for foreseen human faith or good works, God in eternity past chose from among the lot of fallen humanity some to inherit eternal life.
2. **Effectual calling**
    - The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.
3. **Belief in the Gospel**
    - Quickened by the Spirit, the minds of the elect are persuaded of the truths of the Gospel of God’s grace.
4. **Repentance**
    - Likewise enabled by the Spirit the effectually called despise and turn away from all known sins.
5. **Trust in Christ**
    - The effectually called personally commit themselves to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of their life.
6. **Regeneration**
    - God creates in justified believers new life, defined as the radical reorientation of the dispositions and affections toward God.
7. **Union with Christ**
    - The Spirit unites newly born saints with Jesus Christ in a vital, spiritual, and indissoluble union. The NT describes this experiential reality by the familiar “in Christ” motif.
8. **Justification**
    - God in turn reckons believing sinners righteous in his sight and bestows upon them the gift of eternal life.
9. **Sanctification**
    - By a lifelong process that involves both ups and downs the Spirit of grace gradually transforms true believers into the image of Jesus Christ.
10. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - By the application of divine power, God faithfully preserves regenerate saints in faith and hope unto the attainment of eternal life.
11. **Glorification**
    - God perfects the final and complete redemption of the believer—body, soul, and spirit—at the Parousia of the Lord Jesus Christ.
