1. **Calling**
    - The general call to trust Christ is issued through the widespread offer of the Gospel. By means of this general call God sovereignly issues a special calling to the elect. The Spirit facilitates sinners’ response to the Gospel by enlightening their minds, liberating their wills, and inclining their affections Godward.
2. **Regeneration**
    - Without any human assistance the third person of the Trinity creates new spiritual life, including God-honoring dispositions, affections, and habits.
3. **Faith**
    - Having been granted new spiritual life, the elect believe the truths of the Gospel and trust Jesus Christ as Savior. Faith is viewed as a gift and enablement of God, indeed as a consequence of new spiritual birth.
4. **Repentance**
    - Here believers grieve for sins committed and deliberately turn from all known disobedience. This response likewise is a divine enablement.
5. **Justification**
    - On the basis of Christ’s completed work, the Father reckons to believers the righteousness of his Son, remits sins, and admits the same to the divine favor. Justification is the legal declaration of believing sinners’ right standing with God.
6. **Sanctification**
    - The Holy Spirit works in justified believers the will and the power progressively to renounce sin and to advance in spiritual maturity and Christlikeness. By the process of sanctification God makes believers experientially holy.
7. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - The God who has chosen, regenerated, justified, and sealed believers with his Spirit preserves them by his faithfulness and power to the very end. True believers persevere by virtue of the divine preservation.
8. **Glorification**
    - God will complete the redemption of the saints when the latter behold Christ at his second advent and are transformed into his likeness. 

<a name="Amyraldism" href="#contents" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:2.1em;">II. Moderately Reformed &ldquo;Amyraldian&rdquo; (4-Point Calvinist)</a>

Since the only real difference between Calvinism & Moderate Calvinism is the extent of the atonement and slight alteration to the order of decrees, the ordo salutis should be identical to orthodox reformed theology.

<a name="Lutheran" href="#contents" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:2.1em;">III. Lutheranism</a>

⚠️ Lutherans believe baptism is a requirement or condition of salvation, which makes them synergistic. 

<!-- Lutheranism is more accurately described as Melancthonism, since Lutheranism deviated from Luther, an Augustinian monk, who taught the Augustinian view of predestination. -->

1. **Calling or vocation**
    - God offers forgiveness of sins and right standing with himself through the offer of the Gospel that brings with it sufficient grace for the unconverted to respond to the message.
2. **Illumination**
    - The Gospel call universally imparts a certain illumination and quickening that enables the hearer to comprehend the benefits of accepting the Gospel and the consequences of rejecting it. 
3. **Conversion or repentance** 
    - This involves the work of the Spirit that leads sinners to remorse for their sins and to knowledge that they may be saved on the basis of Christ’s merits.
4. **Regeneration**
    - Repentance may result in the kindling of faith in the Gospel and then the transformation known as the new birth.
5. **Justification**
    - In response to a person’s faith God forgives sins, reck­ons the perfect righteousness of Christ, and bestows right standing with himself. 
6. **Mystical union**
    - By this step the believing soul is brought into a supernatural union of love with the triune God
7. **Renovation or sanctification**
    - Assisted by the Spirit, the justified advance in holiness and bring forth the supernatural fruits of the new life.
8. **Conservation**
    - Provided that the justified continue to heed biblical warnings about defection and persist in faith, God will preserve them safely to the end. The unbelieving, however, may fall away from grace and forfeit salvation. Christians must not presume on the Spirit’s grace.

1. **Election**
    - With regard for foreseen human faith, God in eternity past chose those whom he foresaw would have faith in him to inherit eternal life. This is known as the Wesleyan Foreknowledge view of election.
2. **Effectual calling**
    - The Spirit of God illumines the minds and softens the wills of the elect, thus enabling them personally to respond to the external call of the Gospel.
    - The general call to trust Christ is issued through the widespread offer of the Gospel. By means of this general call God sovereignly issues a special calling to the elect. The Spirit facilitates sinners’ response to the Gospel by enlightening their minds, liberating their wills, and inclining their affections Godward.

    - The Holy Spirit works in justified believers the will and the power progressively to renounce sin and to advance in spiritual maturity and Christlikeness. By the process of sanctification God makes believers experientially holy.
7. **Preservation and perseverance**
    - &ldquo;Reformed Arminianism also holds to the perseverance of the saints through faith alone—another tenet of Calvinism—with a caveat. Reformed Arminians believe that Christians can lose their salvation, but only by renouncing their faith. Reformed Arminians reject the idea, found in traditional Wesleyanism, that falling into sin will cause one to fall from grace until repentance restores the sinner back to a state of grace. In other words, according to Reformed Arminianism, a believer cannot fall out of salvation, but he can willingly forfeit it, and once he apostatizes, he is **lost forever**.&rdquo; &mdash; [GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/Reformed-Arminianism.html)
8. **Glorification**
    - God will complete the redemption of the saints when the latter behold Christ at his second advent and are transformed into his likeness. 

<a name="Arminian" href="#contents" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:2.1em;">V. Arminian (5-Point Arminian)</a>

⚠️ Arminians are thrice synergistic: they view regeneration, sanctification, and perseverance as a synergistic activity. While it is true they are synergistic, they are still Protestant in the way that they hold to justification being by faith alone &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; in fruit-bearing, just like any other protestant &lsquo;ism. As long as they place their trust in Christ for salvation and view everything else as &ldquo;*resulting*&rdquo; fruits of the faith, they are saved by grace through faith. This group in particular has created some of the most steadfast and spirit filled Christians I've known in my lifetime. Denominations associated with this theological tradition are Wesleyan and Methodist.

1. **Universal, external calling**
    - God extends the call to salvation to all by a general work of the Spirit on the soul and by explicit Gospel proclamation. [Prevenient or “exciting” grace](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/), which allegedly proceeds universally from the Cross, alleviates the effects of depravity, thereby freeing all persons for moral and spiritual action.
        
    <!-- >⚠️ [Semi-Pelagianism](https://carm.org/about-doctrine/what-are-pelagianism-and-semi-pelagianism/) is a modification of the Pelagianism heresy which was officially condemned by the church at the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431. Semi-Pelagianism was also condemned by the Council of Orange in 529 A.D.  -->

2. **Repentance and faith**
    - Since every person is transformed by prevenient grace, the human will is capable of freely turning from sin unto Christ. Given the fact that God commands sinners to work out their own salvation (Phil 2:12), conversion is a **synergistic activity**.
        >⚠️ Arminians view regeneration synergistically; the new birth occurs as a result of human willing and divine working. p. 35.

3. **Justification**
    - Since God does not declare anyone righteous in principle who is not so in practice, the forensic view of justification (the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to believing sinners) often is rejected. Arminians usually define justification as forgiveness of sins that in turn fosters the moral government of the universe.
4. **Sanctification**
    - Believers should seek that instantaneous, second blessing experience by which the Spirit eradicates sin and fills the heart with perfect love for God and others. This second work of grace is denoted “entire sanctification,” “Christian perfection,” and the “fullness of the blessing.” The term regeneration often is used inclusively to embrace the broad movement of salvation from conversion to sanctification.
        >⚠️ Furthermore, some affirm that God wills that sanctification be perfected in this life by a second work of grace that is said to eradicate the sinful nature and its desires, fill the heart with perfect love for God, and enable Christians to live without willful sin. This decisive post-conversion experience is designated “entire sanctification,” “sinless perfection,” and “full salvation.” p. 35.

5. **Perseverance**
    - Given their strong emphasis on free agency, many Arminians hold that believers by willful sin may fall completely from the state of grace. The possibility of final apostasy motivates Christians to holiness and constancy of life.
        >⚠️  In addition, many Arminians deny the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. They insist that by deliberate sin Christians can renounce their prior faith commitment and thereby fall from the state of grace, forfeit eternal salvation, and be doomed to perdition. The Arminian understanding of salvation thus is synergistic (a “working together”); divine grace and the liberated human will cooperate to bring about salvation. From inception to consummation the unsaved via free will make significant contributions to the outworking of their salvation. p. 35.

<a name="Romanist" href="#contents" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:2.1em;">VI. Romanist (Roman Catholicism)</a>

⚠️ The order of salvation in Roman Catholic theology is usually expressed in terms of the grace mediated by the church’s sacraments ([sacerdotalism](https://carm.org/dictionary/sacerdotalism/)). Roman Catholicism is considered legalistic in it's CCC. They also deviated from St. Thomas Aquinas who taught a form of Augustinian predestination.

1. **The sacrament of *baptism*** (Tit 3:5) 
    - imparts supernatural life by regenerating the soul and uniting it with Christ. Water baptism, in addition, is said to remove the guilt and penalty of original sin. Through the sacrament of baptism “Man is made white as a sheet, brighter than snow.”
2. **The sacrament of *confirmation*** (Acts 8:15-17)
    - strengthens the baptized through a Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Spirit. By this endowment the confirmed are enabled to witness to Christ and to stand firm in the midst of life’s struggles.
3. **The sacrament of the *Eucharist*** (Matt 26:26-28) 
    - imparts spiritual nourishment as the worshiper feeds on the body and blood of Christ in the transubstantiated wafer. “This sacrament is nourishment. It is for the divine life of the soul what food and drink are for the life of the body. This life, the state of grace, is maintained by it, preserved from ruin, strengthened and augmented.”13
4. **The sacrament of *penance*, or the “second pardon,”** 
    - remits the guilt and punishment of post-baptismal, mortal sins (apostasy, murder, adultery). The sacrament requires of the penitent contrition for sins, confession, and works of satisfaction (almsgiving, fasting, etc.).
5. **The sacrament of *extreme unction or last anointing*** (Jas 5:14-16)
    - equips the soul for the final conflict with death and prepares the recipient for the beatific vision of God. This sacrament “gives the grace of a good death, consolation in that depression which comes to so many because of the memory of their sins, and pardon for all sins not yet forgiven in confession.”
