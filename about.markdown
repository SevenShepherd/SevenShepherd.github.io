Hello and welcome, I am Seven Shepherd. I created this blog as a temporary site while I build my Ministry. Please feel free to look around, read articles, or contact me below.

# Recommended Bibles

You'll find the Bibles I actually use listed below. Readability & literalness scores are based on quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical analysis, developed by Dr. Andi Wu. See [Readability & literalness](https://csbible.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quantitative-Translation-Evaluation-by-GBI.pdf). These scores do not denote textual purity, all of the following translations can claim 99.5%+ NT textual purity.

- I currently carry a [Legacy Standard Bible (LSB) New Testament with Psalms & Proverbs](https://316publishing.com/collections/lsb-nt-with-psalms-and-proverbs/products/lsb-new-testament-with-psalms-and-proverbs-goatskin), produced at Royal Jongbloed in the Netherlands in Shamar goatskin.
- I parallel this with [NLT, EXB, and NET Translator Notes](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn+8%3A56-59&version=NLT;EXB;NET)

<!-- For comparison the KJV rates at 48.83% in readability, and 66.58% in literalness to the greek. These scores do not denote textual purity, all of the following translations can claim 99% NT textual purity. -->

<!-- > "**99.8% of textual variants affect nothing**, most are spelling differences. there's different ways to spell John, there's different ways to spell Mary, they're not going to affect anything, but **the one-fifth of 1% that do affect things are the ones that scholars talk about**. The bottom line is it does not matter in some respects which New Testament you use because **no essential doctrine is jeopardized** by any of these textual variants" &mdash; [Professor Daniel B. Wallace, Ph.D.](https://youtu.be/NikVdhp0YFs) -->

<!-- For comparison [The New King James Version](https://www.thomasnelsonbibles.com/about-nkjv-history/) has 177 scholars counting the base text (130 NKJV & 47 KJV) and readability & literalness scores of 60.32% / 65.21% with the KJV rating at 48.83% / 66.58%. The Textual Bases for the Old Testament used in the NKJV is the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (4th ed., 1977) and for the KJV, the Masoretic Text. The New Testament uses the Received Text or [Textus Receptus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textus_Receptus). -->
