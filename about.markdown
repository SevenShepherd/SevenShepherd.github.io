These highly recommended versions and studies push our understanding far beyond our previous limitations. I study with the [ESV Study Bible]() and [Net Full Notes](). I read leisurely with the NLT. If I'm traveling, I'll use something small like the LSB NT w/ Psalms & Proverbs.

<!-- Whereas the ESV represents the worlds most accurate formal equivalent bible, accuracy and literalness not being completely equal, the NET Full Notes represents the very best in optimal equivalence. The NLT is the world's most readable bible. -->

<!-- these versions excel in literalness to the Biblical Hebrew & Koine Greek. -->

|Formal Equivalence<br>"Word-For-Word"|[☩ **ESV Study Bible**]()<br>[ESV Interlinear]()<br>[LSB NT Only](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/legacy-standard-bible/)|

According to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [analysis](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf), the ESV is one of the most literal Bible versions on earth. In addition to this, the Bible Study variant won ECPA Book of the Year and is considered to be the very best study bible.

> “... The ESV is one of the few, and surpasses the others in its simple yet elegant style. In many respects **the ESV has accomplished in the 21st century what the KJV accomplished in the 17th**: a trustworthy, literary Bible that is suitable for daily reading, memorizing, and preaching.” &mdash; Daniel B. Wallace, Ph.D., Executive Director, Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts

The [**ESV Study Bible**]() has over 200+ biblical scholars ([100+](https://www.esv.org/translation/) ESV; 95 Study); 9 countries, 20 denominations, 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities, including Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, London, Japan, California, MIT, Duke, Westminister, Dallas, etc. 20,000 study notes, 80,000 cross-references, 200+ charts, 50+ articles, 240 full-color maps and illustrations.

|Optimal Equivalence<br>"Best-Of-Both-Worlds"|[☩ **NET Full Notes**]()<br>[EXB Expansions]()|

The NET Bible, Full Notes Edition lends an extraordinarily unique perspective, namely, the minds of the translators. This transcends study bibles on details concerning language and translation decisions. **With the translators' notes**, this is the most accurate version of the Bible on earth bar none.

> “**The extensive and reliable notes in the NET Bible were a wonderful help to our translation team as we worked to prepare the English Standard Version.**” &mdash; Wayne Grudem, Harvard, Westminister, & Cambridge educated Research Professor and member of the Translation Oversight Committee of the ESV

The [**NET Bible: Full Notes Edition**]() is a completely new, non-sectarian and "inter-denominational," translation of the Bible with 60,932 translators’ notes, completed by more than <a href="https://netbible.com/preface/">25+ of the world’s foremost biblical scholars</a> from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Columbia, Dallas, etc. This is the largest set of translators’ notes ever created.

|Paraphrase<br>"In-Other-Words"|Not Recommended|

This ministry does not recommend a Bible of the paraphrase type. We would instead direct you to dynamic equivalence. Paraphrases are NOT translations.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:2.1em;">Theology</span>

As far as theology is concerned, I hold to the [Historic Protestant](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) position. I find the Five Solas to be pillars of sound wisdom. Other than this I would describe myself as a **moderate** when it comes the distinctives of Christianity. I propose, we hold to what is true, irrespective of man made theologies, even if it contradicts them all. It would do us all good to remember that we worship a timeless God, every man made theology overlooks that. Mt 24:10.

- I reject the [Calvinist](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-reformed/) view of [limited atonement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/), just like St. Augustine, Luther, & Calvin before me.
- I reject [Hyper-Calvinism (Supra.) & Orthodox Calvinism (Infra.)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/election/#false_dichotomy) for either [Amyraldianism (Sub.)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) or Wesleyan foreknowledge view of [election](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/election/). Jesus died for the sins of the world (1 Jn 2:2).
- I reject [traditional Arminianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-arminian/) as thrice [synergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/synergism/). They view regeneration, sanctification, and perseverance as a synergistic activity. This doesn't mean that I think they're unsaved.
- I reject the label [Lordship Salvation]() because they, sometimes, confuse "resulting" works for "including," moving dangerously close to synergism. I reject it in favor of [**Sola Fide**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/) &mdash; The original 500+ year old lordship position.
- I reject ['80s Free Grace theology](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/repent/) because they reject sound scholarship, lexicon definitions, and the academic community on the meaning of [repentance](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chuck-smith-repentance/) holding to a category mistake. They also altered the reformation doctrine of [faith alone](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/).
- I reject the Sethite view of Gen 6:1-4 in favor of [Hybrid Offspring and Heiser's Divine Council Theory.](https://www.youtube.com/@DRMSH)
- I reject Cessationism for Soft-cessationism or open but cautious continuationism.

> &ldquo;Discussion - YES! Disagreements - YES! Division - NO!&rdquo; &mdash; Chuck Smith, Calvinism, Arminianism, & The Word Of God. p. 16.

Having said that, I still have a tremendous respect for Drs. Wayne Grudem & J.I. Packer, and consider their theologies, **except where we diverge**, to be authoritative and accurate for in-depth study. Dr. Demarest was also instrumental in helping me understand all the different theologies in a way no other teacher could. Drs. Ron Rhodes, John C. Lennox, and the late Michael Heiser have my attention, as I favor moderates and systemless scholars.

<!-- J. I. Packer is equally distinguished and his [*Concise Theology*]() is equally authoritative, just much more succinct and useful for travel. When it comes to the distinctives of soteriology, such as the Calvinist & Arminian divide, refer to Dr. Lennox's [*Determined to Believe?*](). -->

<!-- > <sup>10</sup> And then many will fall away and betray one another **and hate one another**. &mdash; Matthew 24:10 ESV -->

<!-- If I haven't offended you you made yet, just stick around and read a few articles. Truth has that effect. -->

<!-- As a [Historic Protestant](https://bit.ly/3sUSEVG), I can read literature from both Calvinists and Arminians, without accepting their distinctives. While [I reject limited atonement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/) I do consider Wayne Grudem's [*Systematic Theology*]() to be the most authoritative and accurate for in-depth study. I reject his Sethite view for Heiser's Divine Council Theory as well. -->

<!-- J. I. Packer is equally distinguished and his [*Concise Theology*]() is equally authoritative, just much more succinct and useful for travel. When it comes to the distinctives of soteriology, such as the Calvinist & Arminian divide, refer to Dr. Lennox's [*Determined to Believe?*](). -->

<!-- If I had to label myself, I'd probably be [moderately reformed](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/). I'm also a soft-cessationist or open but cautious continuationist. -->

<!-- I would have selected R. C. Sproul's [*Essential Truths*]() as my concise alternative to Grudem's as Sproul's has the edge on Packer's with his charts and summaries, but Packer's is an improvement upon Sproul's in the way of organization and succinctness. These three mark my top three books on theology. -->
