Hello and welcome, I am [SevenShepherd](https://twitter.com/SevenShepherd). I created this blog as a temporary site while my ministry is being built. Please feel free to look around, read articles, or contact me below. 

<!-- !!! In the year 2016, I undertook the task of architecting a bespoke, Python-based Christian ministry, specifically tailored for the Twitter platform, incorporating meticulous programming and automation. This endeavor has been marked by resounding success, running continuously since its inception and facilitated by a purpose-built raspberry pi single-board computer. I extend a cordial invitation to visit @SevenShepherd and witness firsthand the thriving outcome of this technological feat.  -->

> Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately. &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:15 NET 

You can also check out my custom programmed and automated X/Twitter based Christian ministry at [@SevenShepherd](https://twitter.com/SevenShepherd) that has been running successfully since 2016 from a custom built raspberry pi single-board computer. 

I highly recommend the ESV Study Bible and NET Bible: Full Translators' Notes Edition. I read leisurely with the NLT Filament Compact. I also recommend Concise Theology by [J. I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford)](https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo); I reject [limited atonement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/), and may also hold a [foreknowledge](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/election/) view, but I find this text to be pleasing otherwise. I consider myself a theological moderate or even systemless.

<!-- As far as my theology is concerned, I hold to the &ldquo;[historic Protestant](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/)&rdquo; position. Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/) in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10).
