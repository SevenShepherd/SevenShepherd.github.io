Hello and welcome, I am Seven Shepherd. I created this blog as a temporary site while I build my ministry. Please feel free to look around, read articles, or contact me below. 

> Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately. &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:15 NET

You can also check out my custom programmed and automated Twitter based Christian ministry at [@SevenShepherd](https://twitter.com/SevenShepherd) that has been running successfully since 2016 from a custom built raspberry pi single-board computer.

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:24px;">Recommended Bibles</span>

I recently wrote an [**article**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-best-bible/) detailing the reasoning behind my conclusions on which bible versions I use. A half-year after writing the article, I was pleased to find that our findings matched [**Dr. Heiser's**](https://drmsh.com/bible-versions/) who created the Interlinears for Logos Bible Software. 

> ... I recommend the ESV. For a study Bible, however, I like the NET Bible ...

I've also taken into account quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [**analysis**](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf). I personally own, and **highly recommend**, the following versions as they are the best of their respective [**categories**](https://wiki.logos.com/Bible_Translation_Spectrum):

- Optimal Equivalent
    - [**NET Full Notes**](https://amzn.to/3WLAgbr), [EXB Expansions](https://amzn.to/3vlMXy5)
- Formal Equivalent "Word-For-Word"
    - [**ESV Study Bible**](https://amzn.to/3WsN0Uw), [NOAB Annotations](https://amzn.to/3XGvXPg), [LSB](https://316publishing.com/collections/lsb-nt-with-psalms-and-proverbs/products/lsb-new-testament-with-psalms-and-proverbs-goatskin)
- Dynamic Equivalent "Thought-For-Thought"
    - [**NLT Filament**](https://amzn.to/3CcB5Cu) *Most Readable
- Paraphrase "In-Other-Words"
    - Not Recommended

The recommendations above represent the very best university level scholarship using our oldest and best mss nearest to the original autographs. We recommend that you do not depart from the sound scholarship of reasoned eclecticism, which gave us the Greek Critical text that scholars have compiled as closest to the originals.

> ... **the NT has about 5,600 extant copies in Greek alone**, ... **10,000 in latin**, **several thousand copies** ... **several hundred thousand** patristic **quotations** ... &mdash; Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Dallas, Ph.D.) paraphrased.

The KJV is still an option, but consider the following points:
- Commissioned by the [lifelong doctrinal calvinist King James I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Puritans_under_King_James_I).
- Uses [Catholic priest Erasmus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus) 16th century Textus Receptus.
- The Textus Receptus was not historically received by all or even Erasmus himself.
- There are [27 different and conflicting Textus Receptus'](https://textusreceptusbibles.com/Editions).
- Only around <span style="font-weight:bold;color:darkred;">3 manuscripts</span> are used from the ~5000 mss of the Byzantine MT. So it's not actually a Majority text bible.
- Erasmus lacked the last leaf of Revelation, back translated from a defective copy of the vulgate, and created 20 errors that don't exist in any Greek mss, botching the last 6 verses of revelation.
- The Masoretic Text is insufficient to translate the book of Job correctly without the DSS, LXX, and Ugaritic. In fact there's evidence that the translators were guessing.
- The KJV uses a [fake pronunciation](https://alwaysbeready.com/gods-name-jehovah-by-charlie-campbell/) of the Hebrew tetragrammaton several times like the cults do: Ge 22:14; Ex 6:3; Ex 17:15; Jg 6:24; Ps 83:18; Is 12:2; Is 26:4.
- Among the youngest and most error prone mss from the 12th-16th century as opposed to those in the CT which are mere decades from the crucifixion.
- The ESV & LSB are the most literal versions. The KJV is the most literal to the TR, but is outperformed by even the least literal modern translation in accuracy.
- KJV Onlyism is likely a budding cult. The idea that English speakers are required by God to use a Bible translation from 17th century England is ludicrous... God would have had to re-inspired the Bible through the KJV translators which is insane.
- God said knowledge would increase (Dan. 12:4), ergo modern translations should be more accurate.

<!-- you could use the much younger and more error prone Textus Receptus which uses only around **3 manuscripts** out of the 5,600 scholars use. KJV -->


<!-- If you'd rather depart from sound scholarship, you could use the KJV, commissioned by the **[lifelong doctrinal calvinist King James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Puritans_under_King_James_I)**, which uses the **[Catholic priest Erasmus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus)** 16th century Textus Receptus. The TR is 1 of 27 different Textus Receptus' and only uses around **3 manuscripts** from the MT. Additionally they're among the youngest and most error prone.  -->

<!-- , and instead use the Byzantine Majority Text, the [World English Bible (WEB)](https://worldenglish.bible/) is the only Bible in existence to use the full 5000 mss MT. -->

<!-- The KJV, commissioned by the **[lifelong doctrinal calvinist King James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Puritans_under_King_James_I)**, uses the **[Catholic priest Erasmus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus)** 16th century Textus Receptus. This NT Textual Criticism Methodology only used around 3 out of the thousands of mss from the MT and they're among the youngest and most error prone.  -->

<!-- Either way, the best bible is the one you read, since we do have a 99.8% textual purity among all bibles with proven scholarship. -->

Scholarship has proven that **no cardinal doctrine is affected** by any viable variant. Regardless of what text is used, **Jesus is affirmed as God in the flesh, as rising from the dead bodily, as ascending to heaven and as coming again some day.** 

<!-- Although we do not know the exact words of Scripture in every place, even the most disparate schools of thought agree on the vast majority. Depending on how we count, the level of agreement could be up to 98 percent! -->

> "**99.8% of textual variants affect nothing**, most are spelling differences. there's different ways to spell John, there's different ways to spell Mary, they're not going to affect anything, but **the one-fifth of 1% that do affect things are the ones that scholars talk about**. The bottom line is it does not matter in some respects which New Testament you use because **no essential doctrine is jeopardized** by any of these textual variants" &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (Dallas, Ph.D.)](https://youtu.be/NikVdhp0YFs)

<!-- If you'd rather use something traditional, like a thousand years younger and more error prone mss used in the 16th century Textus Receptus from the , instead of university level scholarship, there's always the KJV by the **[lifelong doctrinal calvinist King James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Puritans_under_King_James_I)**. -->

<!-- However, if instead you're looking for the only Bible that uses the full Majority text and it's thousands of mss, instead of the 3 mss that Erasmus used, then the [World English Bible (WEB)](https://worldenglish.bible/) is the only true Majority Text bible in existence. -->

<!-- > Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:15 KJV -->

<!-- > Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth. &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:15 LSB -->
