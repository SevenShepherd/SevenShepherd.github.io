<!-- Essential doctrine was taught to me by Chuck Smith who dedicated me to God at birth, my pretribulational premillennialist views come from Dr. Jack Van Impe as a teen and young adult, as a preteen I deduced hybrid offspring theory on my own and this lines up with divine council theory from Dr. Michael S. Heiser. I have adopted a Non-cessationist stance from Dr. Wyane Grudem, but I held this stance since I was a child from my own experiences. My latest stance was leaving free grace theology for the original reformed theology where grace is also free but repentance & christian ethics is fully acknowledged. My interest in textual criticism is thanks to my own inquisitive nature as a self-taught computer programmer and only intensified by Dr's. Daniel B. Wallace & Michael S. Heiser. -->

- Essential Doctrine
    - God is triune (The Trinity)
    - Jesus Is God made manifest
    - Bodily resurrection of Jesus
    - Ascended to heaven and will return

I recently wrote an [**article**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-best-bible/) detailing the reasoning behind my conclusions on which bible versions I use. A half-year after writing the article, I was pleased to find that our findings matched [**Dr. Heiser's**](https://drmsh.com/bible-versions/) who created the Interlinears for Logos Bible Software. 

> ... I recommend the ESV. For a study Bible, however, I like the NET Bible ... &mdash; Dr. Michael S. Heiser

I've also taken into account quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [**analysis**](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf).

The recommendations above represent the very best university level scholarship using our oldest and best mss nearest to the original autographs. We recommend that you do not depart from the sound scholarship of reasoned eclecticism, which gave us the Greek Critical text that scholars have compiled as closest to the original manuscripts.

You can read some of the reasons why I have moved from the KJV to the ESV, NET, an NLT in this [**article**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/formal/). Keep in mind that scholarship has proven that **no cardinal doctrine is affected** by any viable variant. Regardless of what text is used, **Jesus is affirmed as God in the flesh, as rising from the dead bodily, as ascending to heaven and as coming again some day.** 

> "**99.8% of textual variants affect nothing**, most are spelling differences. there's different ways to spell John, there's different ways to spell Mary, they're not going to affect anything, but **the one-fifth of 1% that do affect things are the ones that scholars talk about**. The bottom line is it does not matter in some respects which New Testament you use because **no essential doctrine is jeopardized** by any of these textual variants" &mdash; [Dr. Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies (PhD, Dallas Theological Seminary)](https://youtu.be/NikVdhp0YFs) -->
