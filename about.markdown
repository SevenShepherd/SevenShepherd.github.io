These highly recommended versions and studies push our understanding far beyond our previous limitations. I study with the [ESV Study Bible]() and [Net Full Notes](). I read leisurely with the NLT. If I'm traveling, I'll use something small like the LSB NT w/ Psalms & Proverbs.

<!-- Whereas the ESV represents the worlds most accurate formal equivalent bible, accuracy and literalness not being completely equal, the NET Full Notes represents the very best in optimal equivalence. The NLT is the world's most readable bible. -->

<!-- these versions excel in literalness to the Biblical Hebrew & Koine Greek. -->

|Formal Equivalence<br>"Word-For-Word"|[▫️ **ESV Study Bible**]()|

According to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [analysis](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf), the ESV is one of the most literal Bible versions on earth. In addition to this, the Bible Study variant won ECPA Book of the Year and is considered to be the very best study bible.

> “... The ESV is one of the few, and surpasses the others in its simple yet elegant style. In many respects **the ESV has accomplished in the 21st century what the KJV accomplished in the 17th**: a trustworthy, literary Bible that is suitable for daily reading, memorizing, and preaching.” &mdash; Daniel B. Wallace, Ph.D., Executive Director, Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts

The [**ESV Study Bible**]() has over 200+ biblical scholars ([100+](https://www.esv.org/translation/) ESV; 95 Study); 9 countries, 20 denominations, 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities, including Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, London, Japan, California, MIT, Duke, Westminister, Dallas, etc. 20,000 study notes, 80,000 cross-references, 200+ charts, 50+ articles, 240 full-color maps and illustrations. Textual Basis: Masoretic Text BHS '83, DSS, LXX, SP, S, Vg; UBS5, NA28. Many distinguished scholars including:

|Optimal Equivalence<br>"Best-Of-Both-Worlds"|[▫️ **NET Full Notes**]()<br>[▫️ EXB Expansions]()|

The NET Bible, Full Notes Edition lends an extraordinarily unique perspective, namely, the minds of the translators. This transcends study bibles on details concerning language and translation decisions. **With the translators' notes**, this is the most accurate version of the Bible on earth bar none.

> “**The extensive and reliable notes in the NET Bible were a wonderful help to our translation team as we worked to prepare the English Standard Version.**” &mdash; Wayne Grudem, Harvard, Westminister, & Cambridge educated Research Professor and member of the Translation Oversight Committee of the ESV

The [**NET Bible: Full Notes Edition**]() is a completely new, non-sectarian and "inter-denominational," translation of the Bible with 60,932 translators’ notes, completed by more than <a href="https://netbible.com/preface/">25+ of the world’s foremost biblical scholars</a> from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Columbia, Dallas, etc. This is the largest set of translators’ notes ever created.

The [**NLT Filament Study Bible**]() has [over 90+ Scholars](https://www.tyndale.com/nlt/meet-the-scholars) in translation from Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Columbia, Westminster, Dallas, etc. The study brings even more to the table. In addition to the NLT being the most readable Bible version on earth according to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [analysis](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf), many distinguished scholars are worth noting:

As far as my theology is concerned, I hold to the [&ldquo;Historic Protestant&rdquo;](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) position. Salvation is by grace through faith alone (Eph 2:8-9; Gal 2:16,21; 3:10-12; 5:4; Ro 3:20,28), but [the faith that saves is never alone](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/faith-alone/) in the person justified (James 2:14-26; Eph 2:10). [Sola fide](/assets/images/solas.jpg).

<!-- <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:2.1em;">Distinctives</span> -->

<!-- When it comes to the distinctives of protestantism, I would describe myself as a moderate. While I have a tremendous respect for [Calvinists](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-calvinist/) ([Infra.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/election/#false_dichotomy)) like Drs. Wayne Grudem, J.I. Packer, & Daniel B. Wallace, I reject [limited atonement](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/limited-atonement/), just like St. Augustine, Luther, & Calvin before me. (1 Jn 2:2; Jn 3:17). -->

<!-- > All of this invalidates the L of TULIP – “limited atonement” – the view that Christ did not actually die for all but only for the “elect”. In fact, not only Luther but many of the other reformers, including Calvin, did not subscribe to limited atonement... this view of the atonement was not even introduced until the second or third generation of Reformers... &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), [*Determined to Believe?*]() p. 179. -->

<!-- On the other side of the matter, I also find [traditional Arminianism](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-arminian/) to be thrice [synergistic](https://carm.org/dictionary/synergism/). They view regeneration, sanctification, and perseverance as a synergistic activity. So I find myself [**debating**](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/election/) between a [Moderate Calvinist](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/) ([Sub.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/election/#false_dichotomy)) or [Moderate Arminian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-moderate-arminian/) ([Wesl.](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/election/#false_dichotomy)) position. -->

<!-- > *"Since scripture teaches divine sovereignty I believe it's absolutely true, and since scripture teaches that I have a free will and that I am responsible then that's something that I believe in too..."* &mdash; [Dr. Ron Rhodes (ThD, Dallas Theological Seminary)](https://youtu.be/Efc5MA2Vtu4) -->

<!-- When you want to learn about Amyraldism you learn it from an Amyraldian, when you want to learn about Calvinism, you learn it from a Calvinist. When you want to learn about Arminianism you learn from an Arminian. When you want to learn about it all, in one book, without any bias, you read &ldquo;The Cross and Salvation&rdquo; by Dr. Bruce Demarest (Ph.D., Manchester), the most fair and irenic theologian I've ever read. -->

<!-- If you attempt to learn about either from the perspective of the opposing side, you will always receive a bias and incomplete education, no matter how fair and irenic they may seem. Below I've recommended the best teachers to represent their own distinctive. -->

Einstein stood on the shoulders of devout Christian minds, and while he was not Christian, he was a deist, so I'm placing him here only for the fact that he recognized the truth, however faint. Science was born in the womb of a Christian worldview.

> “In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views.” (Clark, Ronald W. (1971). Einstein: The Life and Times. New York: World Publishing Company) &mdash; Einstein

<!-- ## 📜 Wisdom & Philosophy -->

<!-- Recent revelatory epiphanies I’ve been attempting to enact. These number among the most difficult things a man can subdue unto himself. It’s easy to live a life of epicureanism, but a true test of inner strength is to imbue one’s soul with stoic equanimity. While my beliefs rest in Christ, my philosophy is not blind to... keep in mind that belief and philosophy are separate. -->

The word philosophy comes from the Greek word philosophia (φιλοσοφία), which means 'love of wisdom'. There is some overlap in my metaphysical & epistemological views. Proverbs 16:16; James 1:5.

> "The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled." &mdash; Plutarch

<!-- > Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence [[Aretē]](https://biblehub.com/greek/703.htm), if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. &mdash; Philippians 4:8 -->

<!-- > Even Gentiles, who do not have God’s written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it. They demonstrate that God’s law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right. &mdash; Romans 2:14-15 -->

<!-- > “How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.” &mdash; Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Meditations  -->

My metaphysical views will always be Christian first and foremost, but otherwise fall within the ontological [mind-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem), more specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism" style="color:#006699;">mind–body dualism</a>.

<a name="epistemology" href="#contents" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:1.6em">7.2 Epistemology (The Nature of Knowledge)</a>

<!-- # Epistemology (The Nature of Knowledge) -->

My epistemological views are first and foremost Christian, but otherwise fall within the school of rationalism (the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive) like that of Descartes, Leibniz, Gödel, and Einstein. Leibniz created calculus independantly of Newton, and paved the way for Einstein's theory of relativity. Einstein called himself a "Leibnizian," but was also a Spinozist. I'm also a fan of skeptical scenarios, they remind me of Revelation 6:14.

<!-- First Principals: from which much can be deduced. For example, Einstein's Theory of Relativity can be used to calculate the effect of the speed of a satellite on time in order to sync a highly accurate clock with Earth time. This can all be done with theories and equations that Einstein produced with rational thought. -->

<!-- Leibniz's best known contribution to metaphysics is his theory of monads, as exposited in Monadologie. He proposes his theory that the universe is made of an infinite number of simple substances known as monads.[72] Monads can also be compared to the corpuscles of the mechanical philosophy of René Descartes and others. These simple substances or monads are the "ultimate units of existence in nature". Monads have no parts but still exist by the qualities that they have. These qualities are continuously changing over time, and each monad is unique. They are also not affected by time and are subject to only creation and annihilation.[73] Monads are centers of force; substance is force, while space, matter, and motion are merely phenomenal. It is said that he anticipated Albert Einstein by arguing, against Newton, that space, time, and motion are completely relative as he quipped,[74] "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions."[75] Einstein, who called himself a "Leibnizian" even wrote in the introduction to Max Jammer's book Concepts of Space that Leibnizianism was superior to Newtonianism, and his ideas would have dominated over Newton's had it not been for the poor technological tools of the time; it has been argued that Leibniz paved the way for Einstein's theory of relativity.[76]

Leibniz distinguishes three forms of evil: moral, physical, and metaphysical. Moral evil is sin, physical evil is pain, and metaphysical evil is limitation.[4] God permits moral and physical evil for the sake of greater goods, and metaphysical evil (i.e., limitation) is unavoidable since any created universe must necessarily fall short of God's absolute perfection.

Leibniz's proof of God can be summarized in the Théodicée.[77] Reason is governed by the principle of contradiction and the principle of sufficient reason. Using the principle of reasoning, Leibniz concluded that the first reason of all things is God.[77] All that we see and experience is subject to change, and the fact that this world is contingent can be explained by the possibility of the world being arranged differently in space and time. The contingent world must have some necessary reason for its existence. Leibniz uses a geometry book as an example to explain his reasoning. If this book was copied from an infinite chain of copies, there must be some reason for the content of the book.[78] Leibniz concluded that there must be the "monas monadum" or God.

The ontological essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity. Unlike atoms, monads possess no material or spatial character. They also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence, so that interactions among monads are only apparent. Instead, by virtue of the principle of pre-established harmony, each monad follows a pre-programmed set of "instructions" peculiar to itself, so that a monad "knows" what to do at each moment. By virtue of these intrinsic instructions, each monad is like a little mirror of the universe. Monads need not be "small"; e.g., each human being constitutes a monad, in which case free will is problematic.

Monads are purported to have gotten rid of the problematic:

interaction between mind and matter arising in the system of Descartes;
lack of individuation inherent to the system of Spinoza, which represents individual creatures as merely accidental. -->

> "My theory is rationalistic, idealistic, optimistic, and theological" &mdash; Kurt Friedrich Gödel

<!-- It is said that he anticipated Albert Einstein by arguing, against Newton, that space, time, and motion are completely relative as he quipped,[74] "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions."[75] Einstein, who called himself a "Leibnizian" even wrote in the introduction to Max Jammer's book Concepts of Space that Leibnizianism was superior to Newtonianism, and his ideas would have dominated over Newton's had it not been for the poor technological tools of the time; it has been argued that Leibniz paved the way for Einstein's theory of relativity. -->

<a name="ethics" href="#contents" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:1.6em">7.3 Virtue Ethics (Moral Philosophy)</a>

<!-- # Ethics (Moral Philosophy) -->

[My ethics views are Christian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/how-do-you-know-you-are-saved/) and are derived from the gospels & epistles. Overtime I have observed the truth (Ro 2:15-16) written upon the hearts men; virtue ethics is rife with examples of human beings exhibiting their design, even when they were unaware of where it came from. I am reminded of how Paul, in Acts 17:16-34, converted many Stoics and Epicureans. 

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">22</sup>So Paul, standing before the council,* addressed them as follows: “Men of Athens, I notice that you are very religious in every way, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">23</sup> for as I was walking along I saw your many shrines. And one of your altars had this inscription on it: ‘To an Unknown God.’ This God, whom you worship without knowing, is the one I’m telling you about. &mdash; Acts 17:16–34 (22-23) NLT

<!-- [Equanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity).   The Roman Stoics called it [aequanimitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity).  -->

<!-- According to the Greek Stoics, [apatheia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheia) was the quality that characterized the sage. -->



<!-- to be a reoccurring theme in the philosophies I gravitate towards. -->

<!-- > "the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, the kind of thing the Universe is and the kind of things we are." &mdash; Lewis, C.S. The Abolition of Man. p. 18. -->

While I find sinicization to be dangerous, I also find it curious that In some Chinese translations of the New Testament, λόγος (logos) is translated with the Chinese word dao (道) (e.g. John 1:1-3,14), indicating that the translators considered the concept of Tao to be somewhat equivalent to logos in Greek philosophy. &mdash; [Sinicizing Christianity, Zheng (2017). p. 187.](https://books.google.com/books?id=M9YkDwAAQBAJ)

<!-- and the Logos (The Word/Jesus) in Christianity -->

<!-- In the thinking of noted Christian author C.S. Lewis, God created the Tao and fully displayed it through the person of Jesus Christ. He asserted that every religion and philosophy contains foundations of universal ethics as an attempt to line up with the Tao—the way mankind was designed to be. In Lewis' thinking, God created the Tao and fully displayed it through the person of Jesus Christ. -->

I've listed below several philosophies that resemble the built in virtues that are inherent to our design. While I am Christian only, I've provided a timeline for perspective.

<!-- *Kurt Gödel's Platonism[8] postulates a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things Husserl said about mathematics, and supports Kant's idea that mathematics is synthetic a priori.) Davis and Hersh have suggested in their 1999 book The Mathematical Experience that most mathematicians act as though they are Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to formalism. The mathematician Alexander Grothendieck was also a Platonist.* -->

The Mozart effect is also interesting to me, and I believe classical music can have beneficial effects on the human brain. Patients with epilepsy find a decrease in epileptiform activity while listening to Mozart’s K.448 and Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488). Tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability are said to be the reason.

Learning a second language can increase problem solving ability.

The [Sapir–Whorf hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKK7wGAYP6k), or Whorfianism, suggests that language affects our world views and perceptions, relative to ones native language.

The world's most widely spoken and most successful constructed international auxiliary language, and the only such language with a population of native speakers. Created by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in 1887, it was intended to be a universal second language for international communication. According to the University of Manchester, the [propaedeutic value of Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto) raises language awareness and accelerates subsequent learning of foreign languages. Esperanto has approximately 2640 root words. The word esperanto translates into English as *"one who hopes"*.

> “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” &mdash; Theodore Roosevelt, "Citizenship in a Republic", a speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, France (23 April 1910)

<!-- > "To be nobody but
yourself in a world
which is doing its best day and night to make you like
everybody else means to fight the hardest battle
which any human being can fight and never stop fighting." &mdash; E.E. Cummings -->

<!-- > "Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. <a href="https://youtu.be/cJMwBwFj5nQ" style="color:#0073e6;">Be water, my friend</a>." &mdash; Bruce Lee -->

<!-- > "There was never a genius without a tincture of madness." &mdash; Aristotle -->
