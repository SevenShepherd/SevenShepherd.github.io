<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:32px;">Recommended Texts</span>

When I study theology in-depth, I consider Dr. Wayne Grudem's [*Systematic Theology, 2nd ed.*](https://amzn.to/40QF8z5) to be the most authoritative and accurate. When I travel I take the equally distinguished [*Concise Theology*](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A) by Dr. Packer, as it is much smaller. Packer *"gratefully acknowledges the hidden hand of R. C. Sproul, from whom came the germ idea for several... outlines."* While Sproul has the edge with his charts and summaries, I do consider Packer's [*Concise Theology*](https://amzn.to/40RYx1A) to be an improvement upon Sproul's [*Essential Truths*](https://amzn.to/3FyUAqx) in the way of organization and succinctness.

<!-- There're quite a few recommendations here, but if I could only pick one, I think I'd choose J. I. Packer's Concise Theology in it's hardcover ESV edition from Crossway. The reason being is because it is concise. -->

<span style="font-style:Italic;font-size:32px;">Recommended Bibles</span>

These **highly recommended** versions and studies push our understanding far beyond our previous limitations. I study with the [ESV Study Bible](https://amzn.to/3WsN0Uw) & [Net Bible, Full Notes Edition](https://amzn.to/3WLAgbr). I read leisurely with the NLT. If I'm traveling, I'll use something small like the LSB NT w/ Psalms & Proverbs.

<!-- Whereas the ESV represents the worlds most accurate formal equivalent bible, accuracy and literalness not being completely equal, the NET Full Notes represents the very best in optimal equivalence. The NLT is the world's most readable bible. -->

<!-- these versions excel in literalness to the Biblical Hebrew & Koine Greek. -->

A study bible is an indispensible tool. This is the best-of-breed, having won ECPA Book of the Year Award. In addition to this, the ESV is one of the most literal Bible versions on earth according to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [analysis](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf). In addition to being literal and accurate, the ESV is easy to read, poetic, and memorizable.

|Optimal Equivalence<br>"Best-Of-Both-Worlds"|[☩ **NET Full Notes**](https://amzn.to/3WLAgbr)<br>[EXB Expansions](https://amzn.to/3vlMXy5)|

The NET Bible, Full Notes Edition lends an extraordinarily unique perspective, namely, the minds of the translators. This transcends study bibles on details concerning language and translation decisions. **With the translators' notes**, this is the most accurate version of the Bible on earth bar none.

> “**The extensive and reliable notes in the NET Bible were a wonderful help to our translation team as we worked to prepare the English Standard Version.**” &mdash; Dr. Wayne Grudem, Harvard & Cambridge educated Research Professor and member of the Translation Oversight Committee of the ESV

|Translation type|Recommendations|
|:-:|:-:|
|Dynamic Equivalence<br>"Thought-For-Thought"|[☩ **NLT Filament**](https://amzn.to/3CcB5Cu)<br>*Most Readable|

The New Living Translation (NLT) is the most readable Bible version on earth according to quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical [analysis](/assets/docs/AnalysisGBI.pdf). Since scholarship has proven that we have 99.8% NT textual purity, we can confidently conclude that the most readable version of the Bible, that has also passed our litmus tests, would be the best version for leisure reading.

⚠️ 1Cor. 6:9 

- <a href="https://amzn.to/3CcB5Cu" style="font-style:Italic;font-size:19px;">NLT Filament Compact Giant Print</a>
    - [Over 90+ Scholars](https://www.tyndale.com/nlt/meet-the-scholars)
    - Translation Type: Dynamic Equivalence "Thought-For-Thought" NOT paraphrase.

|Translation type|Recommendations|
|:-:|:-:|
|Paraphrase<br>"In-Other-Words"|Not Recommended|

This ministry does not recommend a Bible of the paraphrase type. We would instead direct you to dynamic equivalence. Paraphrases are NOT translations.
