Hello and welcome, I am [SevenShepherd](https://twitter.com/SevenShepherd). This is my independent research ministry that I've owned, operated, automated, and maintained since 2016. The X/Twitter account is run from a custom built raspberry pi single-board computer and a custom computer program. Please feel free to look around, read articles, or contact me below.

> Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately. &mdash; 2 Timothy 2:15 NET

A brief overview of my stances are as follows: I am theologically conservative with moderate distinctives ([amyraldian](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-amyraldian/)) and a [compatibilist](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/chosen/) view on predestination and the sovereignty-responsibility tension problem. I could be described as either historically protestant, as I hold to the five solas. I consider myself to be a soft-cessationist, as I cautiously believe in the continuation of the sign gifts, only for those bringing the Gospel to new ears and those building the church. I recommend the ESV Study Bible & NET Full Notes Edition as the most state of the art and accurate Bible versions available.

> But examine all things; hold fast to what is good. &mdash; 1 Thessalonians 5:21 NET

<!-- My favorite Bible teachers, aside from the obvious answer of Jesus, the Apostles, and Kings David & Solomon, would be: D.A. Carson (Ph.D., University of Cambridge), Hugh Ross (PhD, Astrophysicist at University of Toronto), Walter Martin (Ph.D., California Coast University), Ron Rhodes (Th.D., Dallas Theological Seminary), <a href="https://youtu.be/jOFsFgUUdZo" style="color:black;">Dr. J.I. Packer (Ph.D., University of Oxford)</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9e3Y2SMXag" style="color:black;">Dr. Wayne Grudem (PhD, University of Cambridge)</a>, and my original pastors, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP8rIIps4Sk?t=130" style="color:black;">Chuck Smith</a>, & Dr. Jack Van Impe.  -->

<!-- > &ldquo;Artful nature has given to the most perfect animal the same six limits as the cube has, most perfectly marked... Man himself is, as it were, a cube.&rdquo; &mdash; Kepler, Mysterium Cosmographicum. Claude Fayette Bragdon, A Primer Of Higher Space, The Fourth Dimension. p. 67. -->

<!-- My favorite philosophers apart from a biblical context would be: Plato, René Descartes, Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Aesop of Sardis, Lao Tzu (Gia-Fu Feng), Socrates, and Zhuang Zhou. I also really like Charlie Chaplin and his speech in &lsquo;The Great Dictator&rsquo; makes him a philosopher in my book. -->

<!-- > "My theory is rationalistic, idealistic, optimistic, and theological" &mdash; Kurt Friedrich Gödel -->

<!-- Favorite scientists include: Sir Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Michael Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell, Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, Kurt Friedrich Gödel, Dr. Hugh Ross, Dr. John C. Polkinghorne, Dr. John C. Lennox, Dr. Alister McGrath, Dr. Stephen C. Meyer, Dr. Michio Kaku. -->
