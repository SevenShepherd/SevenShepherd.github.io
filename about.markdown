Readability & literalness scores are based on quantitative linguistic comparison of Bible translations using computerized statistical analysis, developed by Dr. Andi Wu. See [Readability & literalness](https://csbible.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quantitative-Translation-Evaluation-by-GBI.pdf). 

<!-- For comparison [The New King James Version](https://www.thomasnelsonbibles.com/about-nkjv-history/) has 177 scholars counting the base text (130 NKJV & 47 KJV) and readability & literalness scores of 60.32% / 65.21% with the KJV rating at 48.83% / 66.58%. The Textual Bases for the Old Testament used in the NKJV is the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (4th ed., 1977) and for the KJV, the Masoretic Text. The New Testament uses the Received Text or [Textus Receptus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textus_Receptus). -->
