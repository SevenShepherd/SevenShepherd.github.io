Hello and welcome, I am [SevenShepherd](https://twitter.com/SevenShepherd). This is my independent research ministry that I've owned, operated, automated, and maintained since 2016. The X.com (formerly Twitter) account is run from a custom programmed raspberry pi single-board computer. Please feel free to look around, read articles, or contact me below.

>> sn Accurately is a figure of speech that literally means something like “cutting a straight road.” In regard to the message of truth, it means “correctly handling” or “imparting it without deviation.”

The Bible tells us to test all things.

## Overview & Recommended Articles

I am a theologically conservative protestant, holding to the [five solas](/assets/images/solas.jpg), with moderate distinctives. I was raised around [Wesleyans (Arminian)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-arminian/) on my grandfathers side, Baptists on my grandmothers, the [Calvary Chapel (Moderate)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/calvary-chapel/) by my parents, and [Reformed Baptists (Calvinist)](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/ordo-salutis-calvinist/) by my life-long friend. After a lifetime in Christianity, and years of recent research, I find myself to be [completely moderate](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/theology/), but loving to all those who hold to [essential doctrine](https://bit.ly/3XJY5AB). I will also peacefully and kindly debate those who are lost in the cults without any animosity.

<!-- My favorite philosophers apart from a biblical context would be: Plato, René Descartes, Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Aesop of Sardis, Lao Tzu (Gia-Fu Feng), Socrates, and Zhuang Zhou. I also really like Charlie Chaplin and his speech in &lsquo;The Great Dictator&rsquo; makes him a philosopher in my book. -->
